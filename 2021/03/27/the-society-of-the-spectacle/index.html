    This essay was adapted from the foreword to my new English edition to Guy
    Debord's 1967 book <em>The Society of the Spectacle</em>.
  </p>
</aside>
<p>Readers of my site may have noticed the many references to Guy Debord in my
writing over the years, and especially since 2016. This is largely because I've
been writing a new edition of his 1967 book <em>The Society of the Spectacle</em>
adapted for our present moment. This edition is
<a href="https://unredacted-word.pub/spectacle">out now on the web</a>. A hardcover edition
will be going on sale at my publisher, █ Unredacted Word and other book sellers
later in April.</p>
<hr>
<p>In this book, Debord describes and critiques the way we live. The power of these
ideas lies in their ability to question, identify, and name the common
assumptions of the present. Debord develops the concept of <em>The Spectacle</em>,
which describes the gaze of contemporary society. From its publication just
before the May 1968 revolt in Paris, and ultimately influencing Occupy Wall
Street, this book continues to transform a wide range of progressive
philosophical and political movements, most notably anti-capitalism,
postmodernism, marxism, and anarchism.</p>
<p>Debord’s work is not an ivory-tower philosophical treatise, it is a cold
analysis of the history and development that leads directly to our present
moment. He critiques various attempts to change society by comparing their
advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, he makes it apparent that <em>a way out</em>
is absurd, and points to only one path forward: a direct democratic movement of
decentralized workers councils, a suggestion made only twice in the entire text.
Most importantly, he emphasizes the importance of validating theory with
practice, and as such, this book is a practical framework for revolutionaries
who <em>think and do</em>.</p>

<p>Debord’s text is concise, economical, poetic, provocative, and difficult. As
Michael Hardt &#x26; Antonio Negri describe it in their notes to <em>Empire</em> as
"delirious".<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> His work contains many references to Hegel and Marx. He uses
words and phrases defined in other Situationist texts, and expects the reader to
be familiar with them. This is to be expected, as he demands much from the
reader, and had written for a small audience of “fifty or sixty people”<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> who
were well versed in the history of the western philosophical tradition.</p>
<p>Debord was concerned that these ideas themselves would be recuperated by
capitalism (see <a href="https://unredacted-word.pub/spectacle/#ref203.1">thesis 203</a>)
so he wrote in a way to limit them to a small and curious audience. His concerns
turned out to be warranted, when a few years later in the early 1970s, the
French Socialist Party under François Mitterrand co-opted the Situationist
phrase "Change Life" as his campaign slogan, and Situationism became the party’s
unofficial ideology—much to the consternation of Debord. His ideas were
difficult because they were abstract, but the abstraction meant that it
continues to remain relevant, arguably even more relevant half a century later.</p>
<p>The very first time I read <em>The Society of the Spectacle</em>, I knew I’d need to
re-read it, and possibly need to re-write it in my own words if I wanted to
truly understand it. It was only once I had grasped the gist of the text, that I
was then confronted with the task of understanding the philosophy behind it.
Debord didn’t lay out his ideas using plain language, because his ideas are
austere, terrifying, and extremely dangerous. He is the kind of philosopher
whose ideas and observations of the world are so bleak that one fears these
ideas reaching mass consciousness.</p>
<p>This book isn’t as much a straight translation as it is an elaboration, or
‘remix’ that attempts to reveal more under the text than existed in the original
and its various translations. Debord hid some ideas. This is an attempt to
contextualize and reveal abstract ideas by bringing in references and
annotations in order to add relevance for our current time. I have added a few
thoughts and examples to help elucidate difficult concepts. In the hope of
making Debord's work more accessible to those unfamiliar with Marx, Hegel, and
the breadth of other works and concepts alluded to in his text, I've knowingly
ossified my own translation. The reader is strongly encouraged to wander from
these pages back to the timelessness of the original—and beyond.</p>
<p>Foreign languages are much like distant places, and the act of translation is to
visit these places. We may recognize similarities, but these places are unique
because they have distinct histories. With languages, words not only have
semantic meaning, but attachments to the rich cultural narratives that tell
their histories, and these words are attached to libraries of other texts within
the same cultural milieu. When translating these words, the histories,
narratives, and cultural aspects most relevant to the original text aren’t
always translatable with words alone; words simply aren’t enough to capture the
rich cultural depth that exists between the words. As such, I’ve tried to add
notes where the text made implicit references. When translating,
"<a href="https://unredacted-word.pub/spectacle/#ref207.1">plagiarism is necessary</a>", it
demands embracing the author’s ideas, and making them semantically and
culturally relevant, and if done well, it can create an entirely new work, a
copy without an original.</p>
<p>This edition isn’t merely a translation of words, but a translation of <em>time</em>.
Since Debord wrote this book, society hasn’t changed in kind, but by degree,
everything is exactly the same, only <em>more</em>. Advertising is no longer prominent,
but dominant. Facebook and Google aren’t merely the tech companies driving the
economy, but have captured the entire advertising industry, monopolized it, and
built the foundations of a new form of capital on the back of data tracking,
profiling, and machine learning: surveillance capitalism. Urban development has
increased separation and inequality to public goods like education and
transportation. Technology is now ubiquitous and we’re all glued to personalized
screens all day, mediating nearly all interactions, even the ways we find love.
For Debord, none of this would be new, only <em>more</em>.</p>
<p>The book before you is my attempt to participate in the development of his
ideas. I’ve tried to ground some of his more abstract ideas upon the terrain of
the recent economic development of surveillance capitalism. The emergence of
commercial social media, particularly, is the confluence of a few concepts
described by Debord: celebrity culture, the perpetual present, and mass media
that work to automate the commodification of personal identity backed by machine
learning.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a translation that aims to stay faithful to Debord’s
classical French prose, this book is not that. There are editions perfectly
suited for that purpose, I would direct you to the translations by Ken Knabb,
Donald Nicholson-Smith, or Fredy Perlman—all of which I referenced extensively
during the preparation of this book. I’d especially like to point out how
valuable Ken Knabb’s annotated translation has been as a resource for this
edition. His work handed me most of these references, and was instrumental in
pointing me in the right direction for a few others. If you are looking for new
insight and academic rigor, I would refer you to Russell, E., 2021 and Bunyard,
T., 2018. All of these editions can be found in the bibliography and are well
worth reading.</p>
<p>I’ve arranged the notes along the margins rather than as endnotes because
they’re meant to be read alongside the main text. If you are reading this book
for the first time, I would suggest reading it in a particular order, as the
first few chapters can be discouraging. I agree with the preface to Ken Knabb’s
2014 translation, in which he suggests starting with chapter 4 and 5 because
they provide relevant historical and revolutionary background that helps to
contextualize the book. From there, read chapter 7 which covers the development
of cities, urban development and social issues. Then move to chapter 8 which
covers culture, the arts, and the history of artistic movements. Finally, read
chapters 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 which establishes his concept of <em>The Spectacle</em> and
provides a comprehensive critique of contemporary society. Thus, my suggested
chapter reading order is: <strong>4, 5, 7, 8</strong>, <em>then</em> <strong>1, 2, 3, 6, 9</strong>.</p>
<p>My hope is to make Debord’s ideas more accessible to first time readers and to
show how much more relevant <em>The Spectacle</em> is today than when it was first
written. I am optimistic that together we <em>can</em> make another world possible.</p>

<p>Quoting Hardt &#x26; Negri: "...Debord recognized this spectacle as the destiny of
triumphant capitalism. Despite their important differences, such authors offer
us real anticipations of the path of capitalist development." And continuting
in their notes: "[The Spectacle], which is perhaps the best articulation, in
its own delirious way, of the contemporary consciousness of the triumph of
capital."

<p>“fifty or sixty people”: In Debord’s <em>Comments on the Society of the
Spectacle</em>, he describes his audience in the first paragraph thus: “These
comments are sure to be welcomed by fifty or sixty people; a large number
given the times in which we live and the gravity of the matters under
discussion. But then, of course, in some circles I am considered to be an
authority. It must also be borne in mind that a good half of this interested
elite will consist of people who devote themselves to maintaining the
spectacular system of domination, and the other half of people who persist in
doing quite the opposite. Having, then, to take account of readers who are
both attentive and diversely influential, I obviously cannot speak with
complete freedom. Above all, I must take care not to give too much information
to just anybody.”

From there, read chapter 7 which covers the development\nof cities, urban development and social issues. Then move to chapter 8 which\ncovers culture, the arts, and the history of artistic movements. Finally, read\nchapters 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 which establishes his concept of \u003cem\u003eThe Spectacle\u003c/em\u003e and\nprovides a comprehensive critique of contemporary society. Thus, my suggested\nchapter reading order is: \u003cstrong\u003e4, 5, 7, 8\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cem\u003ethen\u003c/em\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e1, 2, 3, 6, 9\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hope is to make Debord’s ideas more accessible to first time readers and to\nshow how much more relevant \u003cem\u003eThe Spectacle\u003c/em\u003e is today than when it was first\nwritten. I am optimistic that together we \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e make another world possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-ra\u003cbr /\u003e March 2021\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003csection data-footnotes class=\"footnotes\"\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"footnote-label\" class=\"sr-only\"\u003eFootnotes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"user-content-fn-1\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuoting Hardt \u0026#x26; Negri: \"...Debord recognized this spectacle as the destiny of\ntriumphant capitalism.

But then, of course, in some circles I am considered to be an\nauthority. It must also be borne in mind that a good half of this interested\nelite will consist of people who devote themselves to maintaining the\nspectacular system of domination, and the other half of people who persist in\ndoing quite the opposite.
