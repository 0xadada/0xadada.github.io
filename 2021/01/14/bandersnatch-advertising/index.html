<p><em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em> (2018) is an interactive film in which viewers are
periodically asked to make decisions for the main character Stefan Butler, the
decisions then result in different scenes, and paths through the film, resulting
in a branching path to a variety of endings. Think "choose-your-own-adventure",
but in interactive video.</p>
<p>Since television viewers are conditioned to be passive spectators, the film
included a tutorial early on to help viewers become familiar with the choice
mechanic. The first example asks the viewer to make a seemingly trivial choice
of which breakfast cereal the main character Stefan eats for breakfast: Kellogs
Frosted Flakes™, or Quaker Sugar Puffs™.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“by giving the viewer the power to change the course of the storyline, the
viewer’s role changes from one of voyeurism to one of active surveillance.
Nevertheless, and in reality, the viewer’s new power only increases the
tracking and profiling of his/her choices. We, the viewers, might control
Stefan, but Netflix (the producer of this commodity) panoptically monitors and
surveys us<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>.”</p>

<p>The choice mechanic not only shows the viewer how choices are presented during
the film, but demonstrates how the choice is stored and recalled by the film
later when a retro commercial with Tony the Tiger plays on a TV in the
background:
<a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/netflixs-hit-bandersnatch-takes-interactive-marketing-to-new-level/545202/">programmatic product placement</a>.
This simple mechanic has wide reaching implications for a future of personalized
<em>content marketing</em>.</p>

<p>This mechanic can be infinitely scaled, it would be easy to replace the cereal
box with a simple green screen, and inject the ad in post-production. In fact,
similar technology is already being used by broadcasters of sports matches,
where they show different advertisers on the perimeter boards based on the
viewing market. The difference, of course, is these ads would be placed
per-viewer rather than per-market.</p>
<p>The first phase of advertising was display advertising, brands created single
non-personalized campaigns, to appeal to the widest possible audience. This
campaign included billboards, newspaper &#x26; magazine ads, television, and radio
advertisements. The ads were either stand-alone with billboards, or
content-adjacent with magazine, television and radio advertisements. Placement
was determined by non-specific general demographic data.</p>
<p>With the arrival of the Internet, advertising shifted to online advertising in
which real time bidding platforms placed ads that were tailored to appeal to
certain demographics. This method allows for more control for the advertiser (or
agency) over the individual target audience, rather than just the website or app
it appears on.</p>
<p>With advancements in social media and machine learning, behavioral advertising
emerged as a method to place highly relevant, personalized ads in relevant user
contexts that increases influence in brand-positive consumer outcomes. In
effect, behavioral advertising collects data from web browsing behavior and app
engagement, finding patterns that lead to purchasing outcomes. If a consumer was
frequently searching for plane ticket prices, the targeting system would
recognize this and start showing related adverts across unrelated websites, such
as airfare deals on Facebook. Its advantage is that it can target individual's
interests, rather than target groups of people whose interests may vary. These
ads can be personalized and unique. These ads are content-adjacent.</p>
<p>Where Bandersnatch Marketing is different is how it integrates the technical
advancements of machine learning and big data from behavioral advertising and
marries advertisements directly into the content. In effect, these ads are not
content-adjacent, but content itself.</p>
<p>With this approach, the cereal Stefan eats wouldn't necessarily have been an
obtrusive viewer choice, but instead based upon a real-time ad placement chosen
by an advertising networks knowledge of the individual viewers behaviors on the
Netflix platform or from data collected from other ad networks. For a young kid
it could've been a bowl of Lucky Charms™, for the health-conscious adult siggi's
yogurt, and the Paleo-eating CrossFitter it could've been an Epic™ meat snack
bar.</p>
<p>What this means is, if done well, the ads disappear and become content,
seamlessly. The ads no longer influence buying behavior as much as the entire
experience gently nudges the viewer, more subversively, and more efficiently.
The success of this approach lies in subtlety, the product placement must not be
frequent nor blatant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Even the role we, the interactive viewers, play has now changed. Instead of
being passive viewers/consumers, Netflix has given us the opportunity to
become the new gods, an omniscient presence that controls the Black Mirror
world. A closer look, however, shatters this reality, for the more control we
are given, the more we are manipulated.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Superficially, this approach solves a problem for Netflix: How do you make money
advertising to a userbase who've become accustomed to paying for an entirely
ad-free experience? The approach of content-oriented product placement seems
reasonable, and Netflix will be able to associate products with content,
microgenres, or specific demographics. Additionally, it will be able to directly
test product designs (e.g., two different Frosted Flakes box covers), as a
service Netflix could sell to brands before production begins.</p>
<p>But the bigger business Netflix is building is the underlying infrastructure to
support content-oriented experiences through interactive storytelling and
personalized product placement.</p>
<p>The next phase of innovation points beyond <em>personalized choice of content</em> to
<em>personalized content</em> in which the media itself is customized, tailored, or
generated unique to each individual—leaving them unable to relate to one another
with respect to their media experiences, shared culture, and ultimately we lose
some of our shared perspective on the world around us.</p>

<p>Just like Google built the backbone of search advertising, Netflix is building
the backbone for a future of video storytelling where the <strong>ads and the content
will be impossible to distinguish because they'll become the same thing</strong>.</p>
