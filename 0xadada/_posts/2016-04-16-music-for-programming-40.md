This is the first set mixed in nearly 12 years. Working in an open office space
means many hours of my day are spent listening to music with headphones on,
cranking away at software code.

For me, this means listening to music that doesn't distract from the task of
writing and problem solving. This set was designed in the spirit of
[musicForProgramming.net](http://musicforprogramming.net).

This set was heavily inspired by sci-fi movies that use long scenes to showcase
the vast, open, and cold expanses of space: Solaris, Interstellar, and Gravity
all come to mind.
