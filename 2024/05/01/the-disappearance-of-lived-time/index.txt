which shape perceptions of time.
There is overlap between ages, both temporally and spatially.
An age is more keenly experienced in the city than in the countryside.
The procession of one age to the next doesn’t entail that the previous age has ended, but that its’ forces have receded to the background—they become infrastructural rather than hegemonic.
To illustrate, the mythic narratives that arose from the Age of Gods & Men remain with us in the form of stories and metaphors that provide us with rich cultural allegory.
In another case, the Age of Kings had no definitive end, in fact, relics like the Queen of England still exist, but monarchy is less important these days, and thus has become merely cultural.
Institutions like religion, which previously dominated social organization have similarly receded.
In some sectors, secular life has completely subsumed spiritual life, and spiritual life is relegated to the private domain of the individual.
The ages of the past are still with us, but they’ve become a given, received culture, one that is taken for granted—its issues and contentions are largely settled debate, but remain relevant.
Past ages become social and cultural foundations—but just like a buildings’ foundation, they are more ossified and unchanging.
The hegemonic age, however, dominates in its effects on daily life, it organizes social institutions, it’s open to continual evolution and debate, and is always changing and dynamic.a:T434,
Reproductive time is the primary site of recuperation by neoliberal capitalism as it continues to colonize this time.
It appears across the globe with the defunding of any social services that support reproductive time.
Concrete examples of this include the defunding of public education and the increase of private schools and private childcare; the increase in the costs of college education, the politicization-of & elimination-of reproductive healthcare; the increase in health insurance costs and its decreasing coverage; the reduction of subsidized food and housing programs; the privatization of health services such as the NHS in the UK, and the consolidation of hospitals and outpatient clinics in the US.
These reductions come at the expense of workers, and the costs are borne by workers in terms of both time and money.
The ideological goal of these actions is twofold: shift the burden of reproductive time onto workers by eliminating services and shifting them to the private domain while corporations capture increasing profits by decreasing operational costs.2:["$","article",null,{"className":"hentry h-entry","children":[["$","header",null,{"children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"entry-title p-name","children":"The Disappearance of Lived Time"}],["$","h2",null,{"children":"The Power of ‘No’: Reclaiming Leisure from the Commodification of Time in an Age of Hyperactivity"}],["$","time",null,{"className":"display-date_published__A_L_d dt-published","dateTime":"2024-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","children":"Wednesday May 1, 2024"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"h-card page_byline__wbXsN","children":[" by ",["$","span",null,{"className":"fn p-author p-name","children":"0xADADA"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"entry-content e-content","children":[["$","figure",null,{"className":"rehype-figure","children":[["$","img",null,{"src":"/static/images/2024-05-01-lauterbrunnen-lived-time-vs-spectacular-time.png","alt":"\nThe north face of The Mönch from Lauterbrunnen valley in Switzerland.
