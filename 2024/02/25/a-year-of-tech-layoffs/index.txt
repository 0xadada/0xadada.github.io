9:T431,Some take-aways: I didn‚Äôt make it through the interview process for any startups, only the established companies considered me. I‚Äôm not sure why, maybe startups mimic big companies‚Äô processes without proper validation, or perhaps it‚Äôs age-related‚ÄîI‚Äôm considered a greybeard now. Their technical questions tended to be easier. I had one interviewer ask me ‚Äúhow many dependents will you have on your healthcare plan‚Äù which I pointed out is an illegal question. He stumbled back with ‚ÄúOh, I ask because our individual plan is good, but our family plan isn‚Äôt good‚Äù‚Äîhe went on to describe their company culture as ‚Äúwe hustle, we‚Äôre usually in the office 6-days a week and long nights‚Äù. They are co-opting the hustle culture ethos and filtering for those rise-and-grind 20-something ‚Äòentrepreneurs‚Äô. Is self-exploitation cool again? I know burnout isn‚Äôt. I noped out of that funnel, they went into the ‚ÄòDeclined‚Äô bucket along with another company that pushed back on the value of contemplative thinking and only valued calculative thinkinga:T48a,I‚Äôll end with some advice to those still searching for work. Reach out to ex-coworkers and ask for LinkedIn references, endorsements. Reconnect with people, in real life. It‚Äôll be good for the soul, and you can provide moral support and references for each other. Tending to your network creates luck. Ask yourself whats next. If you‚Äôve never thought about where you‚Äôd like to be in three years,¬†go for a walk and think about it. If you find it hard to wake up excited about work,¬†ask yourself why, and give yourself space to think about it. Ask yourself what skills you want to learn, and start learning them by doing a project. Don‚Äôt learn for learning sake, but apply it to a project, even if an artificial one. Reflect upon your time at your last company. Write a narrative of your time you can use during interviews to describe your experience. Focus on your milestones, challenges, learnings, mistakes, growth and accomplishments. Write a long-form career narrative answering the ‚ÄúTell me about yourself‚Äù question. Write it for yourself, but then shorten it to a 1-2 minute summary that you can recite during interviews.
