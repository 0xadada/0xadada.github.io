c:T41e,In a study of brain plasticity and non-native lexical and segmentation
processes, Sanders et al. in 2002 came up with interesting methods for probing
non-native speakers to see if learning the L2 early in life or later in life
would effect the ability to learn non-native lexical and segmentation processes.
This study would research various language subsystems such as lexico-semantic,
syntactic, and prosodic information processing. Using the earlier proposed
theories that each language uses different methods of speech segmentation
(English: Stress-based, French: Syllable-based, Japanese: Mora-based) they tried
to find if non-native speakers used lexico-syntactic information processes when
segmenting a non-native language (Sanders et al., 2002). Four groups were
obtained to study this hypothesis, a group of native English speakers as a
control group (E), early English Japanese native speakers (JE), early English
Spanish native speakers (SE), late English Japanese native speakers (J), and a
group of late English Spanish native speakers (S). 2:["$","article",null,{"className":"hentry h-entry","children":[["$","header",null,{"children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"entry-title p-name","children":"hello world"}],["$","time",null,{"className":"display-date_published__A_L_d dt-published","dateTime":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","children":"Thursday January 1, 1970"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"h-card page_byline___vuXv","children":[" by ",["$","span",null,{"className":"fn p-author p-name","children":"0xADADA"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"entry-content e-content","children":[["$","figure",null,{"className":"rehype-figure","children":[["$","img",null,{"src":"/static/images/2003-01-01-hikikomori-mt-isolation.jpg","alt":"An image"}],["$","figcaption",null,{"children":"An image"}]]}],"\n",["$","h2",null,{"id":"abstract","children":"Abstract"}],"\n",["$","center",null,{"children":["Colleges of Computer Sciences and Science (Psychology)",["$","br",null,{}]," Northeastern University Boston, MA",["$","br",null,{}]," Topics Concerning Japanese and English Bilinguals "]}],"\n",["$","hr",null,{}],"\n",["$","aside",null,{"className":"note","children":["This article has translations in Spanish.
