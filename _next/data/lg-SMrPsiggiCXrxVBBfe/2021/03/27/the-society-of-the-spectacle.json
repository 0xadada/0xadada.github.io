This is largely because I've\nbeen writing a new edition of his 1967 book <em>The Society of the Spectacle</em>\nadapted for our present moment. This edition is\n<a href=\"https://unredacted-word.pub/spectacle\">out now on the web</a>. A hardcover edition\nwill be going on sale at my publisher, █ Unredacted Word and other book sellers\nlater in April.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In this book, Debord describes and critiques the way we live. The power of these\nideas lies in their ability to question, identify, and name the common\nassumptions of the present. Debord develops the concept of <em>The Spectacle</em>,\nwhich describes the gaze of contemporary society. From its publication just\nbefore the May 1968 revolt in Paris, and ultimately influencing Occupy Wall\nStreet, this book continues to transform a wide range of progressive\nphilosophical and political movements, most notably anti-capitalism,\npostmodernism, marxism, and anarchism.</p>\n<p>Debord’s work is not an ivory-tower philosophical treatise, it is a cold\nanalysis of the history and development that leads directly to our present\nmoment. He critiques various attempts to change society by comparing their\nadvantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, he makes it apparent that <em>a way out</em>\nis absurd, and points to only one path forward: a direct democratic movement of\ndecentralized workers councils, a suggestion made only twice in the entire text.\nMost importantly, he emphasizes the importance of validating theory with\npractice, and as such, this book is a practical framework for revolutionaries\nwho <em>think and do</em>.</p>\n<figure>\n  <a href=\"https://unredacted-word.pub/spectacle/\" title=\"go to Book\">\n    <img src=\"/static/images/2021-04-01-the-society-of-the-spectacle-cover.png\" alt=\"The Society of the Spectacle, cover design\">\n  </a>\n  <figcaption>The Society of the Spectacle, book cover design</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Debord’s text is concise, economical, poetic, provocative, and difficult. As\nMichael Hardt &#x26; Antonio Negri describe it in their notes to <em>Empire</em> as\n\"delirious\".<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup> His work contains many references to Hegel and Marx. He uses\nwords and phrases defined in other Situationist texts, and expects the reader to\nbe familiar with them. This is to be expected, as he demands much from the\nreader, and had written for a small audience of “fifty or sixty people”<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-2\" id=\"user-content-fnref-2\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">2</a></sup> who\nwere well versed in the history of the western philosophical tradition.</p>\n<p>Debord was concerned that these ideas themselves would be recuperated by\ncapitalism (see <a href=\"https://unredacted-word.pub/spectacle/#ref203.1\">thesis 203</a>)\nso he wrote in a way to limit them to a small and curious audience. His concerns\nturned out to be warranted, when a few years later in the early 1970s, the\nFrench Socialist Party under François Mitterrand co-opted the Situationist\nphrase \"Change Life\" as his campaign slogan, and Situationism became the party’s\nunofficial ideology—much to the consternation of Debord. His ideas were\ndifficult because they were abstract, but the abstraction meant that it\ncontinues to remain relevant, arguably even more relevant half a century later.</p>\n<p>The very first time I read <em>The Society of the Spectacle</em>, I knew I’d need to\nre-read it, and possibly need to re-write it in my own words if I wanted to\ntruly understand it. It was only once I had grasped the gist of the text, that I\nwas then confronted with the task of understanding the philosophy behind it.\nDebord didn’t lay out his ideas using plain language, because his ideas are\naustere, terrifying, and extremely dangerous. He is the kind of philosopher\nwhose ideas and observations of the world are so bleak that one fears these\nideas reaching mass consciousness.</p>\n<p>This book isn’t as much a straight translation as it is an elaboration, or\n‘remix’ that attempts to reveal more under the text than existed in the original\nand its various translations. Debord hid some ideas. This is an attempt to\ncontextualize and reveal abstract ideas by bringing in references and\nannotations in order to add relevance for our current time. I have added a few\nthoughts and examples to help elucidate difficult concepts. In the hope of\nmaking Debord's work more accessible to those unfamiliar with Marx, Hegel, and\nthe breadth of other works and concepts alluded to in his text, I've knowingly\nossified my own translation. The reader is strongly encouraged to wander from\nthese pages back to the timelessness of the original—and beyond.</p>\n<p>Foreign languages are much like distant places, and the act of translation is to\nvisit these places. We may recognize similarities, but these places are unique\nbecause they have distinct histories. With languages, words not only have\nsemantic meaning, but attachments to the rich cultural narratives that tell\ntheir histories, and these words are attached to libraries of other texts within\nthe same cultural milieu. When translating these words, the histories,\nnarratives, and cultural aspects most relevant to the original text aren’t\nalways translatable with words alone; words simply aren’t enough to capture the\nrich cultural depth that exists between the words. As such, I’ve tried to add\nnotes where the text made implicit references. When translating,\n\"<a href=\"https://unredacted-word.pub/spectacle/#ref207.1\">plagiarism is necessary</a>\", it\ndemands embracing the author’s ideas, and making them semantically and\nculturally relevant, and if done well, it can create an entirely new work, a\ncopy without an original.</p>\n<p>This edition isn’t merely a translation of words, but a translation of <em>time</em>.\nSince Debord wrote this book, society hasn’t changed in kind, but by degree,\neverything is exactly the same, only <em>more</em>. Advertising is no longer prominent,\nbut dominant. Facebook and Google aren’t merely the tech companies driving the\neconomy, but have captured the entire advertising industry, monopolized it, and\nbuilt the foundations of a new form of capital on the back of data tracking,\nprofiling, and machine learning: surveillance capitalism. Urban development has\nincreased separation and inequality to public goods like education and\ntransportation. Technology is now ubiquitous and we’re all glued to personalized\nscreens all day, mediating nearly all interactions, even the ways we find love.\nFor Debord, none of this would be new, only <em>more</em>.</p>\n<p>The book before you is my attempt to participate in the development of his\nideas. I’ve tried to ground some of his more abstract ideas upon the terrain of\nthe recent economic development of surveillance capitalism. The emergence of\ncommercial social media, particularly, is the confluence of a few concepts\ndescribed by Debord: celebrity culture, the perpetual present, and mass media\nthat work to automate the commodification of personal identity backed by machine\nlearning.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a translation that aims to stay faithful to Debord’s\nclassical French prose, this book is not that. There are editions perfectly\nsuited for that purpose, I would direct you to the translations by Ken Knabb,\nDonald Nicholson-Smith, or Fredy Perlman—all of which I referenced extensively\nduring the preparation of this book. I’d especially like to point out how\nvaluable Ken Knabb’s annotated translation has been as a resource for this\nedition. His work handed me most of these references, and was instrumental in\npointing me in the right direction for a few others. If you are looking for new\ninsight and academic rigor, I would refer you to Russell, E., 2021 and Bunyard,\nT., 2018. All of these editions can be found in the bibliography and are well\nworth reading.</p>\n<p>I’ve arranged the notes along the margins rather than as endnotes because\nthey’re meant to be read alongside the main text. If you are reading this book\nfor the first time, I would suggest reading it in a particular order, as the\nfirst few chapters can be discouraging. I agree with the preface to Ken Knabb’s\n2014 translation, in which he suggests starting with chapter 4 and 5 because\nthey provide relevant historical and revolutionary background that helps to\ncontextualize the book. From there, read chapter 7 which covers the development\nof cities, urban development and social issues. Then move to chapter 8 which\ncovers culture, the arts, and the history of artistic movements. Finally, read\nchapters 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 which establishes his concept of <em>The Spectacle</em> and\nprovides a comprehensive critique of contemporary society. Thus, my suggested\nchapter reading order is: <strong>4, 5, 7, 8</strong>, <em>then</em> <strong>1, 2, 3, 6, 9</strong>.</p>\n<p>My hope is to make Debord’s ideas more accessible to first time readers and to\nshow how much more relevant <em>The Spectacle</em> is today than when it was first\nwritten. I am optimistic that together we <em>can</em> make another world possible.</p>\n<p>-ra<br /> March 2021</p>\n<section data-footnotes class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-1\">\n<p>Quoting Hardt &#x26; Negri: \"...Debord recognized this spectacle as the destiny of\ntriumphant capitalism.
