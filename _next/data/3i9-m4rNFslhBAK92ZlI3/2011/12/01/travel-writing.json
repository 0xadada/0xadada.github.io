My understanding was built upon a small collection of books\nand two <a href=\"http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/\">excellent</a>\n<a href=\"http://12byzantinerulers.com/\">podcast</a> series. While one can learn a great\ndeal from books, podcasts, and other media, that knowledge is divorced from its\noriginal context — i.e. we musn't mistake a map for the territory.</p>\n<p>A museum - by its very nature - strips the subject of its contextual time and\nplace (arguably the time, and sometimes place have been lost to time). A museum\nsucceeds if it is able to recreate the context of the subject in both time and\nplace, within the mind of the museum visitor. This leads to a more delightful\nunderstanding and appreciation of the subject.</p>\n<p>When I travel, I seek to create new understanding - a recontextualization of the\nartifacts of knowledge I grasp on the subject. From facts and anecdotes taken\nfrom books, images and perspectives gathered from museums — all mashed\ntogether again, and then reformed within the milieu of their original spatial\ncontext.</p>\n<p>Its important to note that this is a passive activity, simply walking around\nRome was enough to ignite this recontextualization. Characters take on new\nroles, events have more (or less) relevance, and places are imbued with life,\ncolor and motion. Understanding becomes alive.</p>\n<p>Travel seems to make me step outside the world, so that I can look back upon it\nwith new eyes. And when I return home, my new eyes are the eyes with which I've\nalways viewed the world.</p>\n","slug":"2011-12-01-travel-writing","license":"cc-by-nc-sa"}},"__N_SSG":true}
