Given at the Ember Boston\nCommunity meetup.</p>\n<p>Ember-changeset is an addon that provides an abstraction over Ember models such\nthat only valid data will ever be set in a model.</p>\n<p>Contextual components are a set of conventions that allow a developer to build a\ncomponent that can be customized by its consuming application.
