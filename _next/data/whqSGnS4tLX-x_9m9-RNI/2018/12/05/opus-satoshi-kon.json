The\nfinal 3 chapters were never finished. Between 1996 and his death in 2010, he\nsketched out an abridged final chapter that was included in this book.</p>\n<p>The brilliance of this book is how the final chapter serves as a bookend to his\nlife, how our individual lives are stories left unfinished, and how our loved\nones go on to continue those stories.
