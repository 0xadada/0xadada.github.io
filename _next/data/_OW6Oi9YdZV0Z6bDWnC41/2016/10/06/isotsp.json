Everything that was\ndirectly lived has moved away into representation.\"\n<cite>Guy Debord<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup></cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social relation among\npeople, mediated by images.\"\n<cite>Guy Debord</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Debord observed that the spectacle actively alters human interactions and\nrelationships. Images influence our lives and beliefs on a daily basis;\nadvertising manufactures new desires and aspirations. The media interprets (and\nreduces) the world for us with the use of simple narratives. Photography and\nfilm collapses time and geographic distance ‚Äî providing the illusion of\nuniversal connectivity. New products transform the way we live.</p>\n<p>Debord‚Äôs notions can be applied to our present-day reliance on technology. When\nyou search for a spot to spend the night out with friends, Yelp nudges your\ngroup to search for the new bar selling great craft cocktails. What do you do\nwhen you get lost in a foreign city? Do you ask a passer-by for directions, or\nconsult Google Maps? Perhaps Siri can help. When planning that upcoming\nvacation, do the apps we use help us search for places and sights free to\nexplore, or where to get hotels and restaurants where we will conduct business\ntransactions? Such technology is incredibly useful, but it also subtly engineers\nour behavior. It reduces our lives into a daily series of commodity\nexchanges.</p>\n<p>Debord would not be surprised (and yet horrified) by companies such as Facebook,\nGoogle and Twitter gradually changing us all into brand ambassadors, monetize\nour friendships, opinions and emotions (further mediated through images of Emoji\nü§∑). Our internal thoughts and experiences are increasingly becoming\ncommodifiable assets and \"engagements\" to be touted at board meetings.</p>\n<p>The spectacle, which is driven by economic interest and profit, replaces lived\nreality with the ‚Äúcontemplation of the spectacle.‚Äù Being is replaced by having,\nand having is replaced by appearing. We no longer live. We aspire. We work to\nget richer. Paradoxically, we find ourselves working in order to have a\n‚Äúvacation.‚Äù We can‚Äôt seem to actually live without working. Capitalism has thus\ncompletely occupied social life<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-2\" id=\"user-content-fnref-2\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The more his life is now his [brand or] product, the more he is separated\nfrom his life.\"\n<cite>Guy Debord</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The proliferation of images and desires alienates us, not only from ourselves,\nbut from each other.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<section data-footnotes class=\"footnotes\"><h2 id=\"footnote-label\" class=\"sr-only\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-1\">\n<p>Debord, Guy.\n<em>The Society of the Spectacle</em>.\nTrans.
