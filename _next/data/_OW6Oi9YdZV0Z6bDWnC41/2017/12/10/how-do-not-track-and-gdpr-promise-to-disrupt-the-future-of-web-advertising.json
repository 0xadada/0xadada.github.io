It is the right to control to whom and to\nwhat information is shared with others. Privacy protects the criteria used to\ndetermine how information is deemed private. Simply put, it's ones right to keep\nor share information they themselves deem as private; something is private when\none deems it thus.</p>\n<p>Since the advent of the first banner-ads on the web, advertising has grown to\nbecome the most popular business model, and with the growth of advertising there\nhas been an equal expansion of tracking techniques. These techniques include\ntracking users clicks, the duration of site visits, metrics about device\ncapabilities, the variety of sites visited, and the frequency of these visits\nare only the bare-minimum for todaysʼ tracking analytics. What is considered\n“business as usual” today includes a plethora of intrusive techniques that were\npreviously considered to be spyware. This includes techniques such as mouse\nmovement recording, keylogging, geolocation tracking, and even video recording\nof what the user does on every web site they visit.</p>\n<p>Current tracking practices are intrinsically based on a disrespect of peoplesʼ\npersonal and private data. Tracking companies business models are based on the\npresumption that 1. You forfeits your right to privacy in exchange for\nad-subsidized content, and 2. Your personal data belongs to them. These\nconditions are not sustainable in the long-term if we wish to maintain the right\nto privacy in the future. Privacy will continue to be erroded for all classes of\nsociety, but will especially impact the poor, who cannot afford to opt-out of\nads in exchange for a subscription.</p>\n<h2>Overview of Web Advertising</h2>\n<p>Tracking practices arose from the last twenty five years of the web, during a\ntime when the vast majority of web content was subsidized by banner ad-based\nbusiness models. These models naively depended on the collection of increasingly\nintrusive metrics in order to precisely target consumers. As ad markets became\nmore efficient over time, metrics needed to become more precise in order to keep\nadvertising conversion results positive. Itʼs an arms race between the\nad-networks competing to deliver ads with better and better conversion rates.\nThis model of increased tracking and surveillance in exchange for optimized\nreturn on investment has been called\n“<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism\">Surveillance Capitalism</a>”.</p>\n<p>Ad-networks are middlemen who facilitate a “triangle trade” between\ncontent-providers, advertisers, and users. In this system, a content provider\n(e.g. The Wall Street Journal) wishes to publish a news story to their readers.\nTheir costs include paying reporters, hosting the website, and they wish to be\npaid by an advertiser. The advertiser (e.g. Chase Bank) wishes to get attention\nto their product (e.g. a new savings account), by placing an ad in front of\nusers likely to open a savings account. The advertisers costs include designing\nan ad, and paying the ad-network to place the ad on sites within the ad-network\n(i.e. ad-networks have many sites, one of which is wsj.com). The user wishes to\nread the latest news (preferably for free). The ad-network is a match-making\ncompany, they (via tracking analytics) are able to see which users visit the\nsites in their network of content-providers, and are able to instantly place an\nad for the Chase savings account to the user of the Wall Street Journal who has\na metrics profile most similar to other users who have opened a new savings\naccount recently. The ad-network matches advertisers to the users most likely to\nbuy something from the advertiser. When the ad is placed, the user sees the ad,\nthe ad-network is able to inform both Chase bank and the Wall Street Journal\nthat the ad was seen. Finally, the ad-network is paid by Chase, and the Wall\nStreet Journal is paid by the ad-network for hosting the ad.</p>\n<p>Users “pay” for the websites they visit in hidden ways. They pay by implicitly\nallowing ad-networks to build a marketing profile about themselves. Their\nbrowser automatically sends information to the ad-networks about their browsing\nbehaviors. This happens without users consent or knowledge. This data is shared\nbetween the ad-networks, then aggregated and combined to create detailed\nprofiles containing lists of sites users have visited over time, including what\ntheyʼve done on those sites. This profile is then used to efficiently advertise\nproducts and services to the user.</p>\n<p>Users also pay for the amount of data ads consume on their smartphone data\nplans. For example, on\nTMZ.com<sup class=\"Ref\" id=\"ref:note:1\">[<a href=\"#cite:1\">1</a>]</sup> there are 47\ndifferent trackers, 42 different cookies, and a single page request to the\nhomepage takes 10.02 megabytes of data across 262 requests. This request\naverages 52 seconds to load. The user-experience is slow, and the homepage\ndoesn't allow the user to read a single article. With an ad-blocker installed,\nthe site payload was only 3.87 megabytes of data across 104 HTTP requests,\naveraging 9.76 seconds to load. This is a significant speed and data\nimprovement, and showcases the reduced data savings. Up to 50% of a users\nmobile-phone data plan is used for serving ads,\n<a href=\"http://randomwalker.info/publications/OpenWPM_1_million_site_tracking_measurement.pdf\">each ad taking ~5 seconds to load</a>,\nand decreasing overall phone battery life by ~20%. The top 1-million sites use\nan average of 25-30 trackers.</p>\n<p>Users \"pay\" for content with their security as well. In 2016 malware being\nserved via ad-networks was up\n132%<sup class=\"Ref\" id=\"ref:note:2\">[<a href=\"#cite:2\">2</a>]</sup>.</p>\n<p>The problem with current tracking practices is that <em>users are not empowered to\nmake consensual decisions around how their online behavior is collected and\naggregated</em>. Users are unaware of the sacrifices they're making to view content\nonline.</p>\n<h2>Do Not Track (DNT)</h2>\n<p>Do Not Track is a technology and legal framework that enables users to opt out\nof tracking by ad-networks, analytics services, and social platforms. <em>DNT\nempowers users with a choice they currently don’t have.</em> It's a feature in web\nbrowsers that allows users to express their preference for not being tracked to\nthe web sites and services they use every day. A new set of laws including the\nEU GDPR and California AB 370 provide a legal regime to enforce the respect of\nthis new browser preference. Combined, the technology and law provide a viable\npath forward to reclaim the right to privacy on the web.</p>\n<p>DNT is a user making an explicit feature request, <em>I do not want to be tracked</em>.\nIt is a better version of the Do Not Call registry. DNT is a user preference\nthat forces the browser to send an HTTP request to the server explicitly telling\nthat server not to track user behaviors.</p>\n<h2>Privacy is a Feature</h2>\n<p>People (generally) don’t care about privacy until they’re affected by its' loss.\nA few examples; people provide their email addresses to get a receipt at a\nbrick-and-mortar store after a transaction, but hate when they receive spam.\nPeople use credit cards on sketchy websites, but hate when they see fraudulent\ncharges. People reuse the same weak passwords on multiple websites, but hate\nwhen they get hacked. The problem is an expectation of privacy when they've\ntaken actions that undermine their privacy.</p>\n<p>DNT and the laws that enforce respect for DNT enable users to take action to\nexpress their right to privacy. Web companies and services that respect it have\nan opportunity to benefit. Companies like Apple are setting a good example of\nthis mindset towards privacy by building pro-privacy features and services.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Privacy marketing will be an important value-add for Internet commerce. It\nwill be a terrific way to gain market share at the expense of the competition\n-- or to lose much of your market share, if you find yourself on the wrong end\nof a privacy campaign\n—<a href=\"http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/privacy_marketing.html\">Nick Szabo</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Organizations that respect and offer a straightforward choice around tracking to\ntheir customers will earn their trust and loyalty.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“great experiences don’t have to come at the expense of your privacy and\nsecurity. Instead, they can support them.”\n—<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/privacy/\">Apple</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apple seems to have wised-up to selling privacy as a component of a luxury\nproduct. They have marketed features like TouchID, ApplePay, encryption and\ndifferential privacy as privacy-securing features. At the same time\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/11/30/apple-is-sharing-your-face-with-apps-thats-a-new-privacy-worry/\">they have undermined privacy in numerous ways</a>.</p>\n<h2>The EU GDPR and AB 370</h2>\n<p>Browsers and servers today can implement technological support for DNT, but\nuntil recently, ad-networks had no incentives to honor DNT. The ad-networks\ncontinue to ignore the DNT request, and continue tracking users either\nexplicitly or implicitly. They had clear disincentives to ignore the\nuser-preference.</p>\n<p>California law AB 370 makes it more difficult to continue to ignore DNT without\nexplicitly excluding Californian residents. The law, (regardless of where the\nwebsite is hosted) modifies the California Online Privacy Act. Under SECTION 1,\nSection 22575 requires a site to disclose how it responds to the Do Not Track\npreference.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>SECTION 1. Section 22575</p>\n<p>(5) Disclose how the operator responds to Web browser “do not track” signals\nor other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice\nregarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an\nindividual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party Web\nsites or online services, if the operator engages in that collection.</p>\n<p>(6) Disclose whether other parties may collect personally identifiable\ninformation about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and\nacross different Web sites when a consumer uses the operator’s Web site or\nservice</p>\n<p>(7) An operator may satisfy the requirement of paragraph (5) by providing a\nclear and conspicuous hyperlink in the operator’s privacy policy to an online\nlocation containing a description, including the effects, of any program or\nprotocol the operator follows that offers the consumer that choice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means sites need to explicitly say whether they honor or do not honor the\nuser expression of DNT. This doesn't go far enough to incentivize companies to\n<em>actually</em> honor DNT, it merely incentivizes them to disclose how they address\nthe preference. Ultimately this will not empower users in any practical way.</p>\n<p>EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was designed to harmonize data\nprivacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy\nand to reshape the way organizations across the region approach data privacy. It\nwas approved by the EU Parliament on April 14, 2016 and entered in force on May\n25, 2018 - at which time those organizations in non-compliance could face heavy\nfines.</p>\n<p>You may have already seen the preemptive effects of the EU GDPR in the wild,\nsuch as the \"cookie disclosure\" notice on many sites in the EU and UK: \"Yes, I\naccept cookies\".</p>\n<p>The EU GDPR law goes much farther in that <em>it gives users actual choice</em> rather\nthan just disclosure. To summarize the law, it applies to all companies\nprocessing the personal data of data subjects residing in the EU, regardless of\nthe company’s location. It also applies to a controller or processor not\nestablished in the EU, where the activities relate to: offering goods or\nservices or monitoring of behavior of EU citizens. Non-EU businesses processing\nthe data of EU citizens will also have to appoint a representative in the EU.</p>\n<p>Organizations in breach of GDPR can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover\nor €20 Million (whichever is greater) of the previous year. Most serious\ninfringements are not having sufficient customer consent to process data, or\nviolating the core of Privacy by Design concepts. Companies will no longer be\nable to use legalese terms and conditions, that is to say, request for consent\nmust be in plain language. Any data collection and processing must be directly\nattached to the point where consent is given. Companies can't just collect\ninformation for any purpose, the purpose must be clearly limited and stated.\nFinally it must be as easy for consumers to withdraw consent as it is to give\nit.</p>\n<p>The GDPR includes the \"Right to be Forgotten\", also known as \"Data Erasure\". It\nentitles the user to have the data controller erase personal data upon demand as\nwell as cease further dissemination of the data. It also forces third parties to\nhalt processing of the data.</p>\n<p>“Data Portability” is the right for a user to receive the personal data\nconcerning them, which they have previously provided. It must be in a “commonly\nused and machine readable format”. The user has the right to transmit that data\nto another controller of their choosing.</p>\n<p>A major component of the GDPR is companies can no longer “Collect it all now,\nuse it later”. Under Recital 39, it notes that “specific purposes for which\npersonal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at\nthe time of the collection…” Recital 32 notes that “When the processing has\nmultiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them…” If the data is\nlater to be used outside the scope of original purpose, user must receive an\nexplicit opt-out opportunity accoding to GDPR, Article 6, paragraph 4,\nRecital 50. The language of the original purpose must be in clear, plain\nlanguage (not legalese) according to GDPR, Article 13, paragraph 1, c.</p>\n<p>These regulations together provide a much more user-centric set of rights that\nwere previously impossible for users to exert over data collectors. Together\nwith the DNT feature, users can finally push back against online tracking.</p>\n<h2>Technology Pushes Back Against Tracking</h2>\n<p>DNT and anti-tracking technologies are making the previously hidden practices of\nweb tracking visible to the end-users. This technology will (hopefully) help\nshine light on the seedy underbelly of intrusive advertising. It'll make the\ninvisible visible. These changes will empower users to make informed decisions\nthat were either technically difficult, or outright hidden.</p>\n<p>Safari web browser has a new feature called \"Intelligent Tracking Protection\" or\nITP, which purges third-party cookies that are determined to be able to track\nusers across sites. After 24 hours, the third-party cookies can only be used for\nlog-in purposes if the user visits that site as a top-level domain. All cookies\nare purged after 30 days. The software utilizes a machine learning model to\nclassify which top privately-controlled domains have the ability to track the\nuser cross-site, and those determined to be trackers will be deleted from the\nbrowser.</p>\n<p>Firefox will soon allow users to prevent tracking cookies in the “Tracking\nProtection” feature. Eventually, cookies set without explicit DNT consent will\nbe blocked if the user has enabled Tracking Protection. It remains to be seen if\nthis feature will be enabled by default. Firefox 57\n<a href=\"https://www.janbambas.cz/firefox-57-delays-requests-tracking-domains/\">introduced a change</a>\nto how the browser loads scripts matching domains in their Tracking Protection\ndatabase. This has the effect of reducing the perceptual page load time for the\n1st-party site, and making tracking ads load more slowly.</p>\n<p>Google Chrome will begin filtering obtrusive ads\n<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/12/better-ads\">by default in early 2018</a>.</p>\n<p>Chrome filtering will work by the Google search engine conducting an\n“<a href=\"https://support.google.com/webtools/answer/7072706?hl=en&#x26;ref_topic=7073503\">ad experience review</a>”.\nReviews are periodic, and result in a “passing”, “warning” or “failing” grade\nfor the site under review. The ad review engine crawls a subset of site pages,\nconducts “user-like” interactions, and compares ad experiences to their\n“<a href=\"https://www.betterads.org/standards/\">better ads standards</a>”. If the site\ndetects violations of the standard, the report will result in a “failure”. Sites\nwith ads with a failing Ad Experience Report will have their ads filtered in\nChrome. It remains to be seen if this feature will be enabled by default.</p>\n<p>Chrome ad filtering is controversial because Google has a direct conflict of\ninterest in that its ad filtering will punish the ad-networks that are in direct\ncompetition to the Google-owned Doubleclick ad-network. It is in Googles' best\ninterests to filter ads from their competition, such that it incentivizes\nadvertisers to use the Doubleclick network since Chrome would be filtering ads\noutside the Doubleclick network. This could result in monopolistic behavior on\nthe part of Google.</p>\n<p>A new player in the browser market is the Brave Browser. Brave is founded by\nMozilla founder and creator of JavaScript Brendan Eich. Brave provides an\n\"ad-less\" web experience. It enables a direct monetary relationship between the\ncontent-provider, advertisers, and their user audience (replacing existing\nad-networks). Brave browser will include a new cryptocurrency called the Basic\nAttention Token (BAT) that facilitates a marketplace directly connecting\ncontent-providers, advertisers and users. Users can opt to directly pay the\ncontent-provider for content using the BAT token. Alternatively, users can be\npaid BAT tokens in exchange for seeing ads placed by the advertisers\nparticipating in the Brave ad-network. These BAT tokens can be used to pay for\ncontent created by content-providers. Brave has been tight-lipped about how\nexactly users privacy will be better protected on their ad-network compared to\nexisting ad-networks.</p>\n<p>Another recent entrant into the browser space is <a href=\"https://better.fyi/\">Better</a>,\na browser built according to Ethical Design concepts. This browser eschews\n\"better ads\" standards that companies like Google, Brave, Ghostery, and AdBlock\nPlus are promoting. Instead, it offers a product thats' interests are aligned\ndirectly with consumer interests because they are paid directly by its' users,\nand the business model doesnʼt rely on surveillance capitalism in order to make\nmoney.</p>\n<h2>Preparing for the Future</h2>\n<p>There is potential for the changes described above to have wide impacts on the\nadvertising industry, and I have some recommendations for organizations that\nwish to get ahead of these changes in order to reduce risk and lower the force\nof the impact.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design with privacy as a guiding principal. It's far easier to handle privacy\nconsiderations in the design phase rather than having to backtrack a product\nonce built.\n<ul>\n<li>Design humane technology that respects users privacy.</li>\n<li>Consider where users privacy is placed at risk.</li>\n<li>Design features that achieve a goal with a smaller or no privacy impact.</li>\n<li>Design data collection features that ask for informed, explicit consent.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Differentiate your organization by highlighting a privacy-respecting approach\nto data collection.</li>\n<li>Be a good corporate citizen by empowering your users with choice around how\ntheir data is collected.</li>\n<li>Allow users to both export their data, and delete their accounts from the\nproduct.</li>\n<li>Honor the DNT browser setting according to the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/EFForg/dnt-guide\">EFF DNT Guide</a>.</li>\n<li>Describe\n<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/privacy/approach-to-privacy/\">in plain language</a> how\nusers data is collected and used.</li>\n<li>Reduce the amount of metrics stored internally to the minimum possible, and\npurging that data whenever possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With technology and law moving forward in lockstep, I see a positive path\nforward for the protection of the right to privacy online.</p>\n<aside>\n  <em>\n    This article is adapted from a series of talks given at\n    <a href=\"https://naralogics.com\" title=\"Nara Logics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nara\n      Logics</a> in 2015, and later at \n    <a href=\"https://cinchfinancial.com\" title=\"Cinch Financial\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cinch\n      Financial</a> in 2017.\n  </em>\n</aside>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<cite class=\"hanging-indent\" id=\"cite:1\">\nTMZ.com homepage as of December 2nd, 2017.\n<a class=\"RefBack\" href=\"#ref:note:1\"></a>\n<cite class=\"hanging-indent\" id=\"cite:2\">\n[_Online Tracking: A 1-million-site Measurement and Analysis_](http://randomwalker.info/publications/OpenWPM_1_million_site_tracking_measurement.pdf).\nEnglehardt, Steven and Narayanan, Arvind.\nPrinceton:\nACM CCS 2016.\n2016.\n<a class=\"RefBack\" href=\"#ref:note:2\"></a>\n","slug":"2017-12-10-how-do-not-track-and-gdpr-promise-to-disrupt-the-future-of-web-advertising"}},"__N_SSG":true}
