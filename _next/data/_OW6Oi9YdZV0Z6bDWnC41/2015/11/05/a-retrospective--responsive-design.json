The\n“Responsive” web vs the “m.” web. One pushing for a single codebase that\nresponds to user-context and another pushing for a second, mobile-only approach\n(typically using a subdomain starting with m.) It's clear now,\n<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/responsive/fundamentals/\">the responsive web has won</a>.</p>\n<h2>A Retrospective — Responsive Design</h2>\n<p>The mark of a master woodworker is his/her ability to work with the grain. The\ngrain gives the wood its natural identity and subtly tells the craftsman the\nbest way to work it.</p>\n<p>Work with the grain and save effort. Work with the grain and maximize\nflexibility. Work with the grain and maintain strength.</p>\n<p>Work against the grain at the expense of additional effort on the part of the\ncraftsman as well as reduced flexibility and strength in the wood.</p>\n<p>The same can be said for crafting products on the web. The raw materials are\nHTTP requests, HTML, text, CSS, Javascript, images, and motion.</p>\n<p>To go with the flow of the web-grain is to deliver content quickly, with\nvertically-variable content-flow. Reduce HTTP requests and add complex\nfunctionality using progressive enhancement.</p>\n<p><em>The tools that we design should be user-centric and our metric of success is\nwhen our user puts our tools down. In the end, we want our users to be engaged\nwith the people and world around them, not fumbling with a tool. The tools are a\nmeans, not an end.</em></p>\n<h2>s/Techn/Method/{ology}</h2>\n<p>Server-side web frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, Express all have\nexcellent technologies to define explicit dependencies (e.g., pip with\n<code>requirements.txt</code>, gem with <code>Gemfile</code>, and npm with <code>package.json</code>.)\nConfiguration management tools like Chef, Puppet, Ansible and Docker are making\nthe server-environment both easier to define implicit dependencies and help\nautomate the task of creating homogeneous development and production\nenvironments. Together, these tools can build a reproducible execution\nenvironment where the code can be more fully tested in a space with less far\nless entropy than the web environment.</p>\n<p>The execution environment of the web is extremely heterogeneous: it operates on\na fractured multitude of devices within a dozen of browser of various\ncapability. Bandwidth, CPU speed &#x26; memory, screen size &#x26; pixel density are just\na few of the multitude of variables web developers need to manage. This\ndiversity of environment makes for some very complex problem-solving, but that\nvery heterogeneity is the grain of the web, it’s what gives it resilience and\nstaying-power; it’s the power of decentralization at work.</p>\n<p><em>Responsive design was born out of the complexity and diversity of the web. It\nis not a technology but a methodology used to cope with the diversity of\nenvironments a web product needs to operate within.</em></p>\n<p>We use this methodology to engage in conversation that is optimized for each of\nour users. We do this by taking device-capability, user attention-levels and\ncontext into account; and designing specifically for these variables. This is\nopposed to the familiar approach where we send a canned “one-for-all” solution\nto everyone (and yet no-one in particular.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It’s important to note the different between support and optimization.\nOptimizing for every web-enabled device on earth is impossible, so eventually\nyou need to make the strategic (read: business) decision of what target\ndevices and browsers for which to optimize.”\n—<a href=\"https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/mobile-first-responsive-web-design/\">Brad Frost</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we bifurcate our web experiences into arbitrary “web” and “mobile” buckets,\nwe will then be forced to decide which bucket any new device best fits in. Can\nwe really continue to commit to supporting each new device (as the market\ncontinues to fracture) with a bespoke experience? Doubtful.</p>\n<p>Instead we should shift our thinking: How can our designs best-adapt and flow\ninto the context and environment in which our users operate; in order to best\nserve the goals of the user?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the\nweb medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We\nshould embrace the fact that the web doesn’t have the same constraints, and\ndesign for this flexibility. But first, we must ‘accept the ebb and flow of\nthings’.” -John Allsopp,\n“<a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/dao\">A Dao of Web Design</a>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Up front we should make an important distinction between “responsive design” and\n“web design”; namely that experience design is about purpose, while web design\nis about graphic aesthetics. (Most often, “web design” is just a reference to a\npicture, a design comp.)</p>\n<p>While the design comp can refer to the aesthetics of the product, it doesn’t\ncommunicate its essences of motion, interaction, performance or scalability.\nOften times this communication exists completely outside the comp (in a\ndiscussion or meeting), or alongside it. The evidence of this gap in\ncommunication is the reliance on design-document annotations using the following\nwords:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Fades”</li>\n<li>“Jumps”</li>\n<li>“Flips”</li>\n<li>“Shrinks”</li>\n<li>“Collapses”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, when considering whether or not to implement experience design into\nbusiness strategy,\n<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2013/10/25/responsive-design-will-your-mobile-customer-thank-you/\">a major trade-off to keep in mind is that marketing and graphic design stakeholders will be relinquishing control to other stakeholders</a>.\nAn experience-oriented approach can make the marketing team out feel like\nthey’ve been taken out of the driver’s seat. The graphic\n<a href=\"https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/introducing-the-new-responsive-designed-bostonglobecom.html\">design team needs to be ready for a challenge, amicable to iteration and prototyping as well as forgiving about variability in the final outcome</a>.</p>\n<p>In order to advocate for the grain of the web, our job must become political and\ninclusive. We need to use sensitivity, language and organizational politics to\nget all stakeholders to reach consensus.</p>\n<p><em>“Like celebrities on the cover of a magazine, ‘pixel-perfect’ execution on the\nweb is only ever achieved in Photoshop.”</em></p>\n<h2>What “Responsive design” Is</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A process</li>\n<li>A relinquishing of the false sense of comfort we get when designing for a\n“design comp”</li>\n<li>An experience-first / MVP friendly approach to building dynamic, consistent\nand importantly a <em>complete</em> experience that adapts to users context</li>\n<li>A conduit for the flow of of communication, and much much like water, it flows\ninto different browsers &#x26; devices, flows into robot search engine crawlers,\nflows into RSS feeds, flows into meta-data (hReview) parsers, flows into\nprinters, flows into read-later tools like Web Clippings, Pocket, Instapaper\nand FlipBoard</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Responsive Design as a catalyst for organizational change</h3>\n<p>Responsive design is more of an organizational challenge than a technical\nchallenge.</p>\n<p>The challenge for teams structured traditionally into Business, Product, UX,\nDesign, Development, QA is that they operate in a waterfall process, with\nlittle-to-no feedback cycle and a lack of cross-disiplinary team member\ninvolvement. Accountability to the result moves top-down and never bottom-up.\nProduct has little push-back on business, UX has little weight to affect product\ndecision, and then down the waterfall, design has little affect on the UX\ndecisions. Once in development, the dev-team has little affect backwards up the\nchain. This always guarantees last-minute compromise and needless wasted effort.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2015-11-05-waterfall.png\" alt=\"The waterfall process\" title=\"Waterfall process\">\n  <figcaption>The Waterfall Process. Guaranteed to fail(tm).</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>As the workflow gets closer to Launch, changes to the design become more and\nmore expensive. This creates an expensive, rigid and compromised final product.\nMost importantly, the end-users aren’t impressed and team members are annoyed\nwith all the compromises made. Nobody is happy.</p>\n<p>Using a cross-disciplinary, phased collaborative approach, we benefit from\ndeliverables that can validate our decisions much earlier in the process, and\nimportantly- those decisions are less complex (read: less expensive) to change.</p>\n<p>This process is called the\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170108012509/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model\">Spiral Model Process</a>\nand it goes hand-in-hand with Responsive Design Methodology. All team members\nare involved in the development of the product early and often. Team members\nfeel like they have more input on a wider aspect of the product, and this\nresults in higher levels of personal responsibility and acts as an intrinsic\nmotivator for all team members.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2015-11-05-spiral.png\" alt=\"The Spiral process\" title=\"Spiral process\">\n  <figcaption>The Responsive Methodology, and example of the Spiral Process Model lifecycle.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Just remember, Responsive Design isn’t a set of CSS features, a technology stack\nor a set of tools. Its when an organization decides to collaborate around a\nprocess; with accountability to the user first, to each other second, and to\nsolve the technology last, once all important decisions have been made.</p>\n<h2>More reading on “Responsive Design” and organizational change</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Upstatement &#x26; Filament Group\n<a href=\"https://legacy.upstatement.com/work/boston-globe/\">discusses their approach</a>\nto the redesign of the Boston Globe</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mattandrews.info/2013/05/responsive-design-at-the-guardian-port-80.html#/\">Matt Andrews on the responsive redesign</a>\nat the Guardian UK</li>\n</ul>\n","slug":"2015-11-05-a-retrospective--responsive-design"}},"__N_SSG":true}
