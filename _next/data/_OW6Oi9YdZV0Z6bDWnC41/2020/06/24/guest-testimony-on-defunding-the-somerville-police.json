I am white. I am a public\nschool teacher. I am a mother. And I am a jew.</p>\n<p>Since the day I became a mother, I have been afraid for my child’s life. I am\nashamed to say that it wasn’t until recently that I came to see (though I will\nnever fully understand) the burden of fear that black and brown womxn carry as\nthe mothers, sisters, daughters, and friends of black and brown children.</p>\n<p>As a teacher, I believe that we cannot correct history without fully examining\nit, and this is why it’s important to acknowledge that slave patrols evolved\ninto modern police departments, and the racist history of the police has yet to\nbe reconciled. Since the beginning, the police have always enforced the law,\nregardless of how racist those laws were. After the abolition of slavery, slave\npatrols took on new forms such as sheriffs who enforced segregation or vigilante\ngroups like the KKK. In the North, police were used to control the increasing\nnumbers of immigrant workers, and block labor strikes to suppress poor\nAmericans.</p>\n<p>Saying “defund the police” means that I acknowledge this history and I want to\ntake money away from an organization that continues to protect the comfort and\nwealth of white people, while oppressing and killing people of color, without\naccountability.</p>\n<p>As a jew, the closest comparison I can draw to empathizing with Black and Brown\nwomxn is considering the following: if the police organization in America was\nstarted by the Nazis, and after WWII, they no longer labeled themselves as Nazis\nbut the laws they enforced still allowed them to violently uphold segregation,\nthere is no way that I would ever teach my child that some police officers are\ngood, and some will protect them.</p>\n<p>For my child’s safety, I would teach them that all police officers are\nrepresenting a systemically racist organization that they are obligated to\nfollow orders from. And that, because of this, they must assume that they will\npotentially be harmed or killed at the hands of any person from this\norganization. This is what Black and Brown womxn have to teach their children.</p>\n<p>We should not be giving $18.2M to an organization that forces any of our\nSomerville residents to have these conversations with their children at the\ndinner table. Defund the Somerville Police.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<aside>\n  <em>This testimony was prepared and given on June 24th, 2020 at the Somerville\n  City Council Finance Committee hearing on the FY-21 Budget.</em>\n</aside>\n","slug":"2020-06-24-guest-testimony-on-defunding-the-somerville-police"}},"__N_SSG":true}
