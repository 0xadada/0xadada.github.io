Think \"choose-your-own-adventure\",\nbut in interactive video.</p>\n<p>Since television viewers are conditioned to be passive spectators, the film\nincluded a tutorial early on to help viewers become familiar with the choice\nmechanic. The first example asks the viewer to make a seemingly trivial choice\nof which breakfast cereal the main character Stefan eats for breakfast: Kellogs\nFrosted Flakes™, or Quaker Sugar Puffs™.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“by giving the viewer the power to change the course of the storyline, the\nviewer’s role changes from one of voyeurism to one of active surveillance.\nNevertheless, and in reality, the viewer’s new power only increases the\ntracking and profiling of his/her choices. We, the viewers, might control\nStefan, but Netflix (the producer of this commodity) panoptically monitors and\nsurveys us<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup>.”</p>\n<figcaption>\n  —Nada Elnahla\n  <cite>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nada_Elnahla\" title=\"\">Black Mirror: \n    Bandersnatch and how Netflix manipulates us, the new gods</a>\n  </cite>\n</figcaption>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The choice mechanic not only shows the viewer how choices are presented during\nthe film, but demonstrates how the choice is stored and recalled by the film\nlater when a retro commercial with Tony the Tiger plays on a TV in the\nbackground:\n<a href=\"https://www.marketingdive.com/news/netflixs-hit-bandersnatch-takes-interactive-marketing-to-new-level/545202/\">programmatic product placement</a>.\nThis simple mechanic has wide reaching implications for a future of personalized\n<em>content marketing</em>.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2021-01-14-cereal.png\" alt=\"You decide: Sugar Puffs or Frosties\">\n  <figcaption>You decide: Sugar Puffs or Frosties</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>This mechanic can be infinitely scaled, it would be easy to replace the cereal\nbox with a simple green screen, and inject the ad in post-production. In fact,\nsimilar technology is already being used by broadcasters of sports matches,\nwhere they show different advertisers on the perimeter boards based on the\nviewing market. The difference, of course, is these ads would be placed\nper-viewer rather than per-market.</p>\n<p>The first phase of advertising was display advertising, brands created single\nnon-personalized campaigns, to appeal to the widest possible audience. This\ncampaign included billboards, newspaper &#x26; magazine ads, television, and radio\nadvertisements. The ads were either stand-alone with billboards, or\ncontent-adjacent with magazine, television and radio advertisements. Placement\nwas determined by non-specific general demographic data.</p>\n<p>With the arrival of the Internet, advertising shifted to online advertising in\nwhich real time bidding platforms placed ads that were tailored to appeal to\ncertain demographics. This method allows for more control for the advertiser (or\nagency) over the individual target audience, rather than just the website or app\nit appears on.</p>\n<p>With advancements in social media and machine learning, behavioral advertising\nemerged as a method to place highly relevant, personalized ads in relevant user\ncontexts that increases influence in brand-positive consumer outcomes. In\neffect, behavioral advertising collects data from web browsing behavior and app\nengagement, finding patterns that lead to purchasing outcomes. If a consumer was\nfrequently searching for plane ticket prices, the targeting system would\nrecognize this and start showing related adverts across unrelated websites, such\nas airfare deals on Facebook. Its advantage is that it can target individual's\ninterests, rather than target groups of people whose interests may vary. These\nads can be personalized and unique. These ads are content-adjacent.</p>\n<p>Where Bandersnatch Marketing is different is how it integrates the technical\nadvancements of machine learning and big data from behavioral advertising and\nmarries advertisements directly into the content. In effect, these ads are not\ncontent-adjacent, but content itself.</p>\n<p>With this approach, the cereal Stefan eats wouldn't necessarily have been an\nobtrusive viewer choice, but instead based upon a real-time ad placement chosen\nby an advertising networks knowledge of the individual viewers behaviors on the\nNetflix platform or from data collected from other ad networks. For a young kid\nit could've been a bowl of Lucky Charms™, for the health-conscious adult siggi's\nyogurt, and the Paleo-eating CrossFitter it could've been an Epic™ meat snack\nbar.</p>\n<p>What this means is, if done well, the ads disappear and become content,\nseamlessly. The ads no longer influence buying behavior as much as the entire\nexperience gently nudges the viewer, more subversively, and more efficiently.\nThe success of this approach lies in subtlety, the product placement must not be\nfrequent nor blatant.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Even the role we, the interactive viewers, play has now changed. Instead of\nbeing passive viewers/consumers, Netflix has given us the opportunity to\nbecome the new gods, an omniscient presence that controls the Black Mirror\nworld. A closer look, however, shatters this reality, for the more control we\nare given, the more we are manipulated.”</p>\n<figcaption>\n  —Nada Elnahla\n  <cite>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nada_Elnahla\" title=\"\">Black Mirror: \n    Bandersnatch and how Netflix manipulates us, the new gods</a>\n  </cite>\n</figcaption>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Superficially, this approach solves a problem for Netflix: How do you make money\nadvertising to a userbase who've become accustomed to paying for an entirely\nad-free experience? The approach of content-oriented product placement seems\nreasonable, and Netflix will be able to associate products with content,\nmicrogenres, or specific demographics. Additionally, it will be able to directly\ntest product designs (e.g., two different Frosted Flakes box covers), as a\nservice Netflix could sell to brands before production begins.</p>\n<p>But the bigger business Netflix is building is the underlying infrastructure to\nsupport content-oriented experiences through interactive storytelling and\npersonalized product placement.</p>\n<p>The next phase of innovation points beyond <em>personalized choice of content</em> to\n<em>personalized content</em> in which the media itself is customized, tailored, or\ngenerated unique to each individual—leaving them unable to relate to one another\nwith respect to their media experiences, shared culture, and ultimately we lose\nsome of our shared perspective on the world around us.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2021-01-14-ads.jpg\" alt=\"Google ads, the paid search results have, over time, become so hard to identify that they've become indistinguishable from organic search results.\">\n  <figcaption>Google ads, the paid search results have, over time, become so hard to identify that they've become indistinguishable from organic search results.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Just like Google built the backbone of search advertising, Netflix is building\nthe backbone for a future of video storytelling where the <strong>ads and the content\nwill be impossible to distinguish because they'll become the same thing</strong>.</p>\n<section data-footnotes class=\"footnotes\"><h2 id=\"footnote-label\" class=\"sr-only\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-1\">\n<p>Nada Elnahla.
