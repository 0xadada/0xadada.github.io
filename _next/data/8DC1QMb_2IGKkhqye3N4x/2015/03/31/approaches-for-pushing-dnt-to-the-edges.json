Content providers are\neither ignoring the setting, or giving lip service to DNT while taking no action\nbehind the scenes.</p>\n<p>Worse yet, if users are able to find the browser preference, they don’t\nunderstand its purpose or value. Enabling the feature is confusing, and quite\ninconsistent between browser vendors.</p>\n<p>Goggle Chrome hides the feature behind an “Advanced” barrier. Features and\nsettings are typically placed behind this type of barrier when the feature could\ncause problems for novice users, or as a catch-all for rarely used features.\nFeatures labelled “Advanced” intimidate many users from activation.</p>\n<p>Chrome labels the feature: Send a “Do Not Track” request with your browsing\ntraffic which is misleading; an additional request is not sent, instead a header\nis included in requests made to the server.</p>\n<p>Chrome further discourages activation with a confirmation dialog containing a\nwall of legalese when the user clicks the check box.\n<a href=\"http://gfycat.com/BeautifulInfiniteKob\">see video illustration</a></p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2015-03-31-dnt-chrome.png\"\n    alt=\"Google Chrome settings panel\" title=\"Google Chrome settings panel\">\n  <figcaption>\n    Google Chrome hides the Do Not Track feature behind a wall of legalese\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Mozilla Firefox features the DNT setting more prominently at the top of the\nPrivacy tab. While the wording is simple and clear, it offers little contextual\nexplanation, and provides no incentives to encourage activation.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2015-03-31-dnt-firefox.png\"\n    alt=\"Google Chrome settings panel\" title=\"Google Chrome settings panel\">\n  <figcaption>Firefox provides no incentives to activate the DNT\n    feature.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Apple Safari is the most confusing, it labels the DNT feature with the text\n“Website tracking” followed by a check box. This construction misleads users\ninto thinking that enabling the feature will act as an explicit opt-in to\nwebsite tracking. Ask websites not to track me is a request to opt-in to a\nnegative; this requires a moment of mental aerobics many users trip over.</p>\n<p>This of course, discourages users from enabling the setting.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2015-03-31-dnt-safari.png\"\n    alt=\"Safari settings panel\" title=\"Safari settings panel\">\n  <figcaption>The Safari setting misleads users into thinking that\n    enabling DNT will be an opt-in to website tracking.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Microsoft made a bold choice by choosing to enable DNT on by default in Internet\nExplorer 10. A great example to set, and good for their user privacy. The\nwording of the feature label could use some clarification however.</p>\n<p>Again, the wording here misleads users into thinking that additional requests\nare made to sites they visit.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2015-03-31-dnt-ie.png\"\n    alt=\"IE 10 settings panel\" title=\"IE 10 settings panel\">\n  <figcaption>Internet Explorer 10 enables DNT by default.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>DNT is not a technical problem</h3>\n<p>At its core, this is a social problem, not a technical problem. There are four\nstakeholders involved, all their interests need to be aligned in order for this\nproject to succeed. The user needs to understand the value of DNT to their\neveryday privacy. The browser vendor needs to be encouraged to implement DNT\nthat best serves their interests: acquiring &#x26; maintaining users, and\naccommodating content providers.</p>\n<p>If DNT is going to succeed, the approach needs to give incentives to both\nbrowser users as well as content providers.</p>\n<h3>The Approach</h3>\n<p>The most effective way to promote the adoption of DNT is to appeal to peoples\nemotions.</p>\n<p>Lets first consider the appeal to fear. An appeal to fear will result in web\nbrowsers who are afraid of marketing companies building “Shadow Profiles” behind\ntheir backs and black-masked hackers around every corner looking to steal their\nidentities. An appeal to fear will result in content-providers fearing the day\nsearch engines begin punishing them for failing to honor DNT.</p>\n<p>The alternate approach is to appeal to positive emotions. Highlight the user\nbenefits of DNT as a browser feature that promotes privacy, while highlighting\nthe business benefits of DNT to content providers, search engines and browser\nvendors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reward users by showcasing what they gain by enabling DNT.</li>\n<li>Reward browser vendors who implement DNT in a user-friendly way.</li>\n<li>Reward content providers that honor DNT with increased search engine position.</li>\n<li>Reward search providers by increasing or maintaining user return rate</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Users</h3>\n<p>Users will be empowered when they’re given tools to control their online\nprivacy. This is initially an emotional feeling when their browser displays a\nmessage in the UI indicating their privacy is more protected, but more long term\nit maintains free agency with ones interaction with the web.</p>\n<h3>Browser Vendors</h3>\n<p>Browser vendors will be motivated to increase user acquisition and maintenance\nas users switch to the browser with more simple and easy to-use privacy-centric\nfunctionality.</p>\n<p>Browser vendors should increase DNT usage by defaulting to <code>DNT=1</code> when the user\nenables privacy mode.</p>\n<h3>Content Providers</h3>\n<p>Sites offering pro-DNT content and services will acquire more visits with higher\nsearch engine placement; once Search providers begin rewarding sites that honor\nDNT.</p>\n<h3>Search Providers</h3>\n<p>As users migrate to search providers that offer pro-privacy services, these\nproviders will see an uptick in user acquisition.</p>\n<p>There is an emerging privacy market, and those with pro-privacy offerings will\neventually be the ones who win — as marketing surveillance becomes more\nubiquitous and users wise-up to its encroachments on privacy.</p>\n<h3>Updates</h3>\n<p>January 2019: Apple Safari browser has\n<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari_release_notes/safari_12_1_release_notes#3130299\">removed support for the expired Do Not Track standard to prevent potential use as a fingerprinting variable</a>.\n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/\">Tracking Protection Working Group</a>\nhas been closed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dnt-dashboard.mozilla.org/\">Mozilla DNT Usage Metrics Dashboard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-tracking/2012Jun/att-0095/compromise-proposal-pde-tl-jm.html\">W3C Unofficial Draft Proposal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/\">W3C Tracking Preference Expression (DNT)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://donottrack.us/docs/FTC_Privacy_Comment_Stanford.pdf\">FTC Comment on DNT</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Do_not_track_field_guide\">Do Not Track Field Guide (Mozilla)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://donottrack.us/cookbook/\">Do Not Track Implementation Cookbook</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Thanks</h4>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@mickd\">@MickD</a> for informing me that Microsoft\nIE10 comes with DNT enabled by default.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This article was originally published on\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@0xadada/approaches-for-pushing-do-not-track-to-the-edges-70f0edb2b927\">Medium.com</a></p>\n","slug":"2015-03-31-approaches-for-pushing-dnt-to-the-edges"}},"__N_SSG":true}
