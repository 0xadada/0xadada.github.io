You are your\nwork, and your value and place in the social hierarchy is defined by your job.</em>\nThere is a built-in assumption that ones job defines ones personal identity<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>This ideology sustains the basis for capitalistic inequality</strong>. The work-ethic\ncreates two groups of people: those who work hard and are deserving salvation\nand those who do not. In defining the qualities of a ‘Good’ person, its’\nnegation reveals those who are unmentionable; the ‘Bad’ person: the sinner, the\nlazy, the thief. There is a third group outside of the <em>unmentionable</em>, the\n<em>unmentioned</em>: those too young, too old or unable to take part in work, those\nprevented from work, those who don’t work, and those who don’t believe in the\n<a href=\"http://www.crimethinc.com/\">work-ethic</a>.</p>\n<p>In asking the question, two assumptions are made:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The other person has a job</li>\n<li>Their job describes their identity to some extent. (For many people, this\ndoesn't apply.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>During conversation, this question can be interpreted as a strategic move by the\ninterrogator. In asking first, the interrogator is positioned to answer the\ncounter-question with a more strategic response. This response can establish the\nupper hand in the contextual social hierarchy. Much like claiming higher ground\nprior to battle. It can come off as setting a stage to brag about ones job.\nThose conversations tend to unfold something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Roy: “So what do you do?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Steve: “I work at a red-sauce joint in Brookline” (see note)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Roy: [Puffs his chest] “I’m the Director of Technology at EvilCorp”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When asked “what do you do?” I try to be very generic and skirt the expected\nresponse: “I read and ride bikes every day”. For one, most people don’t care\nabout the answer, they ask out of cultural habit. If pressed about my job, I\nusually say “I make internet stuff” and explicitly leave any job title or\nhierarchy out of the response.</p>\n<p>A better question to ask people in a social setting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who do you know that I know?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This question has a goal, namely to create a real connection between people that\nexists beyond bullshit corporate jargon and hierarchy.</p>\n<p>If we want to move beyond a society structured by hierarchy and class, we need\nto think outside our own ideology before we speak.</p>\n<section data-footnotes class=\"footnotes\"><h2 class=\"sr-only\" id=\"footnote-label\">Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"user-content-fn-1\">\n<p>Its also a uniquely American question to ask. In Europe you don't hear this\nquestion asked at parties, because work doesn't define their lives outside\nof work. A broad generalization, but a correct one. <a href=\"#user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-backref class=\"data-footnote-backref\" aria-label=\"Back to content\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n","slug":"2015-08-02-so-what-do-you-do","license":"cc-by-nc-sa"}},"__N_SSG":true}
