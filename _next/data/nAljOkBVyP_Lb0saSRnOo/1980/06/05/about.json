I ride\na custom built track bike all year. I carry a Google Pixel 5\". I've been a\nlong fan of Google Android hardware having used the HTC Dream/G1, Nexus S and\nNexus 5. I always leave home with\n<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60524683-0xadada?shelf=currently-reading\">whatever book I'm reading at the moment</a>\npaired with a Moleskine notebook for note-taking and writing essays.

This was the best\nlaptop ever made by Apple, last good one before the shitty touchbar\ngeneration. Otherwise a good 27\" retina display, and a keyboard. Ample space\nfor books and a library nearby.</li>\n</ul>\n","slug":"1980-06-05-about"}},"__N_SSG":true}
