The build mission is a trackable street car with a\nwhole bunch of very subtle OEM+ aesthetic changes.</p>\n<p>I've given myself a few principals to guide the build:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Subaru BRZ / Toyota 86 is a <strong>perfectly balanced drivers car for those on a budget.</strong></li>\n<li>This build will be a trackable street car, in that order.</li>\n<li>Power is a band-aid for poor setup and lack of driving skill.</li>\n<li>Nobody is impressed if you can only pass in the straights.</li>\n<li>Weight and simplicity are key: Complexity means more maintenance, more weight, more cost, more heat, and more futzing at the track: reducing fun and seat time.</li>\n<li>A car that reinvigorates the idea of driving delight at an affordable price.</li>\n<li>Drive it to the track &#x26; back</li>\n<li>Make power with 93 Octane</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After a six-month search for a gently used Crystal White Pearl Kouki (2017-2020)\nBRZ or 86, I found one on the Subaru Certified Pre-Owned web portal in Annapolis\nSubaru. I called them and immediately put down a deposit. I rented a car and\ndrove 11 hours on a Friday night, starting at 10pm, arriving at 9am Saturday\nmorning. The car was in great condition, and lucky for me, this was <em>just</em> before\nCOVID-19 caused used-car prices to skyrocket.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2022-10-05-brz-typera-2022-spec-01.jpg\" alt=\"2017 Subaru BRZ Type RA\">\n  <figcaption>\n    2017 Subaru BRZ Type RA at Palmer Motorsports Park.
