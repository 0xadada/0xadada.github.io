In fact, improved roads and transport have reversed the\nancient pattern and made cities the centers of work and the country the place\nof leisure and of recreation.”</p>\n<figcaption>\n  <cite>\n    <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=UUMoGmujREwC&pg=PA173&lpg=PA173&dq=%22Another+characteristic+reversal%22&source=bl&ots=2E5XNz0d_S&sig=s669uSFDmRDh9TE3ZdZr-WtuAR0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPgdnridfRAhVi54MKHZ3BBn4Q6AEIEzAA#v=onepage&q=%22Another%20characteristic%20reversal%22&f=false)\">Understanding\nMedia</a>\n  </cite>\n  &mdash;\n  Marshall McLuhan\n</figcaption>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to describe how farmers lived and worked on the land in the\ncountryside. The rise of industrialization lead to a shift in the focus of labor\nactivities to the factory and centers of production around the factory — the\ncity or urban area. The invention of the train helped to leverage the growth of\nthe cities by facilitating transportation between centers of production for both\nresources and labor. Similarly, the rise of the automobile and interstate\nhighway systems directly resulted in the development of suburban areas.</p>\n<p>McLuhan utilizes the agrarian-to-industrial economic shift as a template by\nwhich we will see the next shift; from an industrial economy to an information\neconomy.</p>\n<p>The (in his words) “electronic economy” or information economy (in contemporary\nparlance) will be a new economic/societal shift in which the information\ninfrastructure (fiber optics, cheap hardware, ubiquitous internet access) will\nafford another shift from the centers of industrial production back to the\ncountryside — ie: working remotely from your country home.</p>\n<p>McLuhan, in the dawn of the color-TV era, was widely seen as a visionary capable\nof seeing deep into societal shifts before they happened, and providing guidance\nas they unfolded. Perhaps his works should be revisited, as they continue to\nprovide useful insights.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>McLuhan, Marshall.\n<em><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/understanding-media\">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</a></em>.\nCambridge: MIT,\nPrint. 1994.</p>\n","slug":"2015-03-17-mcluhan-understanding-media","license":"cc-by-nc-sa"}},"__N_SSG":true}
