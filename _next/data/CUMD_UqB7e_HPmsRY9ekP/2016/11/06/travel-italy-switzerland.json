One must be ready and \"in the\nmood\" to open ones mind and experience life from a new perspective.</p>\n<p>The distance travelled is of no importance when the most distant places on Earth\ncan be connected to within a 24-hour period and a few short layovers. The travel\ndoesn't even begin until you have arrived at your destination. Perhaps it’s how\nthe distances are percieved that really matters. If ones perception of 2,400\nmiles is two mediocre movies and a few bad in-flight meals, perhaps it’s not\nreally \"travel\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The air traveller only travels after he has landed.”</p>\n<figcaption>\n  &mdash;\n  Marshall McLuhan,\n  <cite>\n    Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man\n  </cite>\n</figcaption>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After travelling through Croatia in 2014, I wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I most enjoyed the activities where we weren't charged an entry fee.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Riding a scooter through the countryside of Hvar</li>\n<li>Swimming off the coast of the island of Vis, free to explore the coves and\nrock formations</li>\n<li>Aimlessly wandering the streets of ancient Croatian cities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When an entrance fee is charged, I felt a certain manicured, restricted, and\n“ushered” experience. Krka National Park— while attempting to showcase the\nnatural beauty of the region, it failed because the experience was limited to\na short walk along a wooden boardwalk. A long queue of tourists snaked around\nthe park, each one experiencing the same thing, taking photographs on cue from\nthe designated \"Scenic Vista\" points along the way.</p>\n<p>It was a nature park that offered a menu of canned experiences devoid of\nanything approaching natural.</p>\n<p>Entry fees and queues are a good sign that more authentic experiences can\nprobably be found elsewhere. Freely wandering without a guide, without a\ndestination, and without expectation can get you very far.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Its October 2016. I have the privilege of quitting my job at an Artificial\nIntelligence startup in Cambridge that I've been helping to build for the last\nfour and a half years. I'm ready for some serious alone-time, away from\ncomputers, the internet, and people. I need time to myself, time to have\nunstructured thought, time to get outside my own skull. I've got a little more\nthan two weeks of unscheduled time to tramp around from Italy into Switzerland.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2016-10-27-travel-val-ferret.jpg\"\n      alt=\"Looking northeast up the Italian side of the Val Ferret, to Switzerland\"\n      title=\"Looking northeast up the Italian side of the Val Ferret, to Switzerland\">\n  <figcaption>\n    Looking northeast up the Italian side of the Val Ferret, to Switzerland\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>This trip was about actually travelling between places on my own feet.\nNavigating terra incognita by push my own limits- setting a goal on the horizon\nand getting there by any means. My goal was to hike across the border from italy\ninto Switzerland via the Italian/Swiss Alps.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2016-10-28-travel-val-ferret-pano.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Looking southwest from the Col Val Ferret into Italy\"\n    title=\"Looking southwest from the Col Val Ferret into Italy\">\n  <figcaption>Looking southwest from the Col Val Ferret into Italy</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Importantly, this trip wasn't about setting off on a 'Hero's Journey', to return\nhome a changed man, but to spend time alone to better understand myself. It was\na journey inwards. More than anything else, I had ample time to myself, whole\ndays went by without talking to anyone.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“For my part, I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel's\nsake. The great affair is to move; to feel the needs and hitches of our life\nmore clearly; to come down off this feather-bed of civilization, and find\nthe globe granite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints.”</p>\n<figcaption>\n  &mdash;\n  Robert Louis Stevenson,\n  <cite>\n    Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes\n  </cite>\n</figcaption>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I learned to be kind &#x26; gentle with myself, to calm my own anxieties when\nstressed, to assess reality with facts and realize only my actions will have any\nimpact on the outcomes. To foster a feeling of contentment with what <strong>is</strong>, not\nwhat could or may be. These are things I discovered not out on the road, or on a\nmountain path, but within myself. These learnings are not discoverable by going\nfarther, or hiking higher, but by allocating time and opening oneself to finding\nthem. One has to both open the door, but then be willing to walk through the\ndoorway.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2016-10-30-travel-augstmatthorn.jpg\"\n    alt=\"The ridge of the Augstmatthorn, Interlaken Switzerland\"\n    title=\"The ridge of the Augstmatthorn, Interlaken Switzerland\">\n  <figcaption>The ridge of the Augstmatthorn, Interlaken Switzerland</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Travel is just a big distraction of novelty and the remarkable. It's easy to\nforget everything and be immersed in the distraction. In a world where we all\nbecome hyperspecialized in our careers, travel lets you multiply your\nexperiences of life, hopefully getting a taste of other possible lives so you\ncan tell yourself what it would've been like. Travel becomes the yearly\nexperience people remember, the marker we live by when our lives become banal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Tourism, human circulation considered as consumption, a by-product of the\ncirculation of commodities, is fundamentally nothing more than the leisure of\ngoing to see what has become banal. The economic organization of visits to\ndifferent places is already in itself the guarantee of their equivalence.”</p>\n<figcaption>\n  —Guy Debord,\n  <cite>The Society of the Spectacle</cite>\n</figcaption>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So if you are looking for something inwards, be prepared to focus on whats\ninside, not whats outside. Travel can be an escape from oneself or ones\nresponsibilities, an escape more powerful than other forms of escape.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2016-10-31-travel-eiger.jpg\"\n    alt=\"The north face of the Eiger\"\n    title=\"The north face of the Eiger\">\n  <figcaption>The north face of the Eiger</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In the end, travel for self-improvement is snake-oil just as any other form of\norganized, packaged, advertised and productized self-improvement (e.g. self-help\nbooks, expensive Yoga classes, meditation get-aways, therapy sessions, magical\npotions and boner pills). The real work can't be bought, it must be practiced-\nand you don't need to leave the house to do it. Travel doesn't change personal\ngrowth any more than puzzels improve intellectual growth.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2016-11-06-travel-home.jpg\"\n    alt=\"Home, the journey inwards\"\n    title=\"Home, the journey inwards\">\n  <figcaption>Home, the journey inwards</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<cite class=\"hanging-indent\" id=\"cite:1\">\nDebord, Guy.\n<em>The Society of the Spectacle</em>.\nTrans.
