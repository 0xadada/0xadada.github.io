They were influenced by ideas\ncoming out of the Enlightenment, specifically Adam Smith, Locke, Rousseau, and\nthe conception of humans resorting to \"the state of nature\" and acting in\nbad-faith with one another.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“fuck the monarchy, let's experiment with a rational government based on\ncontract law and this new capitalism stuff.”</p>\n<figcaption>\n  —The Forefathers™,\n  <cite>The Federalist Papers</cite>\n</figcaption>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem with this type of Hobbesian thinking is \"man will resort to kill or\nbe killed in the 'state of nature'\" and therefore the State must enforce\ncontacts to ensure civility and protect the rights of property.</p>\n<p>My thinking is more aligned with Zeynep Tufecki:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We think of society as this Hobbesian thing, as opposed to the reality where\nmost people are very friendly, most people are prone to solidarity.”</p>\n<figcaption>\n  Zeynep Tufecki\n  <cite><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/business/media/how-zeynep-tufekci-keeps-getting-the-big-things-right.html\">How\n    Zeynep Tufekci Keeps Getting the Gig-things Right</a>\n  </cite>\n</figcaption>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In disasters and daily life, people want to help each other, and feel as part of\nsomething greater than themselves. The atomization of the individual, a result\nof capitalism, continually undermines this fundamental aspect of the human\nexperience.</p>\n<p>So when we've built our government on Hobbes as our fundamental philosophical\nideology, we've ended up institutionalizing the idea that civil society is\n\"every man for himself\" rather than \"every man for each other\" and those\ninstitutions become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thus, we've expanded on the US\nexperiment in capitalism by privileging corporations with more rights and\nfreedoms than humans, but without the social or moral responsibilities. That can\nonly end badly when their only motive is profit. Then we've built this enormous\napparatus of violence in the US military, the national guard, a decentralized\npolice force, and a word salad of agencies like the NSA, CIA, FBI, CBP, TSA,\nATF, hell even the USPS has an armed force. All these agencies assume the\naverage person is acting in bad-faith, and yet we wonder why these armed agents\nare killing people by the thousands and without accountability and most often\nwith total immunity.</p>\n<p>This is all to say, the experiment in democratic Hobbesian capitalism should be\ncancelled. Its core assumption are all wrong: it assumed infinite resources on a\nfinite planet which is wrong, it assumed the worst of people which is wrong, It\nabsolved corporations of any ethics and granted them freedom and\nrights—which is wrong.</p>\n<p>The experiment is no longer producing the outcomes for which it once\npromised—based on the idea of the social contract established by Rousseau,\nwhich provides for social reciprocity: we chose the laws under which we live.\nThis is less and less the case. We're increasingly seeing wealth for the few and\nsocial precarity for the many, under a system of governance that responds to\ncorporations before it responds to people.</p>\n<p>It's time to try a new experiment in resource allocation and governance that is\negalitarian, sustainable, and provides a vision where all inhabitants of this\nplanet act in good faith towards a project for multiple worlds, and many\npositive futures. Other <em>worlds</em> are possible.</p>\n","slug":"2020-09-04-the-us-is-a-failed-experiment","license":"cc-by-nc-sa"}},"__N_SSG":true}
