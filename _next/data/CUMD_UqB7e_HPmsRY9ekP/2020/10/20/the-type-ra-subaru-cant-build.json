It comes with\na factory rollcage, 4-point Takata harnesses, air-oil cooler, no trunk interior\ntrim, no radio or sound system, unpainted door handles, 16\" steel wheels, and no\nunderbody panels. The idea is you'd replace much of these parts yourself in\norder to build a race car to compete in the racing series.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2020-10-20-badge.jpg\" alt=\"OEM 2018 Subaru WRX STI Type RA Rear Trunk Emblem Nameplate\">\n  <figcaption>\n    OEM 2018 Subaru WRX STI Type RA Rear Trunk Emblem Nameplate\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>This is the OEM badge that appeared on the 2018 Subaru WRX Type RA edition, of\nwhich only 500 were made. The STI's Type RA suffix stands for Record Attempt, in\nreference to the highly modified WRX STI Type RA NBR that Subaru used to set a\nlap record at the N√ºrburgring Nordschleifes for a sedan at 6\"57s. This was also\nthe very same vehicle Mark Higgins drove at the Isle of Man TT course and set\nthe record at 17\"35s. Japanese manufacturers love badging of this type, and\nfamously the Nissan Skyline team badged their GT-R R34 with a \"V-Spec II Nur\" emblem\nto mark their achievements at the Ring.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2020-10-20-wrx-sti-type-ra-nbr.jpg\" alt=\"WRX STI Type RA NBR\">\n  <figcaption>\n    WRX STI Type RA NBR\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The \"Type RA\" in Subaru parlance means the raw form, usually lighter more than\nanything else. The production 2018 STI type RA got 5 more horsepower, slightly\nshorter 3rd gear ratio, inverted Bilstein front struts, carbon fiber roof and\nrear wing and 19\" wheels with 245/35R19s and put the car on a tiny diet losing\nonly 53lbs off the regular 2018 STI, which is still a beast at nearly 3,380lbs.\nFor all that reduction, they still add nearly\n$12,000 to the price tag, pumping the monster up to the $50k pricetag. We've\ntruly entered the age of postmodernism when the marketing team advertises\n\"reduced\" features and actually adds to the pricetag. Fat-free, gluten-free, and\nfree-range, but you'll pay extra for it.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2020-10-20-wrx-sti-type-ra.webp\" alt=\"2018 WRX STI Type RA\">\n  <figcaption>\n    2018 WRX STI Type RA\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I am more interested in referencing the 2002 WRX STi Spec-C Type RA, which stood\nfor \"Rally Applicant\". This car was stripped of all luxuries: sound system, air\ncon, power windows &#x26; locks, trunk trim, airbags, underbody coating all in the\nname of weight reduction. It was 116lbs lighter than a base model WRX. It had a\ncool roof vent and a quicker steering ratio. It had hand-ported heads that\nflowed far better (note: when building the engine for the RASpec Impreza, I\nfound a set of Spec-C heads, and they were my favorite part of that build.) It\nproduced more power and yet remained affordable <strong>because</strong> it was stripped\ndown.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2020-10-20-2002-wrx-sti-spec-c-type-ra.jpg\" alt=\"2002 WRX STI Spec-C Type RA\">\n  <figcaption>\n    2002 WRX STI Spec-C Type RA\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In 2020, legally, Subaru can't sell a production vehicle without air bags, and\nsupply chains dictate costs, which means that power windows <strong>are</strong> actually\ncheaper than roll-up windows because the entire product line uses the same\nmotors. Part sharing at scale as large as Subaru means part sharing savings make\nit cheaper than deploying roll-up windows in a small-scale production run as\nwell as keeping spare-parts on hand for repairs and service. Air conditioning\nhas become a marketing necessity, as have power door locks. ABS brakes are also\nlegally required to pass local safety standards along with standard shoulder\nseatbelts.</p>\n<p>If we want a truely lightweight track-oriented weapon like the 2002 WRX STI\nSpec-C Type RA, we'll need to build it ourselves... or really, deconstruct the\ncars we have, in order to make one.</p>\n<p>On my car, the RA badge is a reference to that first 2002 WRX STi Spec-C Type\nRA, the purest and most raw form of the WRX. Oh, and I almost forgot, it stands\nfor a reference to the driver, me, \"Type Ron A.\" üòè</p>\n","slug":"2020-10-20-the-type-ra-subaru-cant-build","license":"cc-by-nc-sa"}},"__N_SSG":true}
