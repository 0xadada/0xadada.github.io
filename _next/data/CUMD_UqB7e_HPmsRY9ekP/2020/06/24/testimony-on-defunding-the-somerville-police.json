This militarization has lead to the increase of police violence\nnationally, spanning a long history from the Watts Rebellion to Rodney King, the\nKneel Movement and most recently with #BlackLivesMatter. This is yet another\nexample of the cycle of racist imperialism coming home.</p>\n<p>Dr. Casey Delehanty and colleagues at Gardner-Webb University found<sup>1</sup>\nthat districts that received the maximum 1033 transfers are twice as likely to\nhave police killings compared to districts that receive none.</p>\n<p>There is little evidence that such militarization reduces crime, and\nconsiderable evidence that it both alienates communities and escalates police\nviolence against their own population.</p>\n<p>We're also seeing the effects of imperialism on our soldiers coming home and\nfinding the most relevant jobs in the police force, and yet their mandates are\ndiametrically opposed. Many of these soldiers carry the mental scars of war, are\nbeing streamlined from the streets of Fallujah to the city blocks of the US with\nlittle mental heathcare or transitional training.</p>\n<p>It is therefore in the best interests of our community to demilitarize and\ndefund the police, and in doing so, we work towards a more <strong>just</strong> society that\napplies to <strong>all</strong> members of our community.</p>\n<aside>\n  <em>This testimony was prepared and given on June 24th, 2020 at the Somerville\n  City Council Finance Committee hearing on the FY-21 Budget.</em>\n</aside>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/usa/USHRN15.pdf\">IN THE SHADOWS OF THE WAR ON TERROR: PERSISTENT POLICE BRUTALITY AND ABUSE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE UNITED STATES: A report prepared for the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dissidentvoice.org/2014/02/coming-home-to-roost/\">Coming Home to Roost: American Militarism, War Culture, and Police Brutality</a></li>\n</ul>\n","slug":"2020-06-24-testimony-on-defunding-the-somerville-police","license":"cc-by-nc-sa"}},"__N_SSG":true}
