Each\nside keeps placing the other in numerous rhetorically charged categories that\nobscure the root of their separation. Are we divided by geography being <em>coastal\nelites</em> or <em>fly over states,</em> or are we merely parties like Dems or GOP? It is\nmore likely that we are merely optimists and pessimists. It is also likely that\npessimists who take power can never flip and create optimism.</p>\n<p>Peeling back the rhetoric, our divide is near the root of our value system where\nwe decide to believe whether people are inherently good or bad. Always the\noptimist and running on a platform of hope, Obama, frequently said very plainly\nhe believes people are inherently good. A recent\n<a href=\"https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/opinion/why-rural-america-voted-for-trump.html\">NYTimes op-ed</a>\nquotes an astute baptist minister from the other camp who says: “The difference\nbetween Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans believe people are\nfundamentally bad, while Democrats see people as fundamentally good,”.</p>\n<p>Believing someone to be inherently good or bad has profound impact on policy.\nPessimists, often religious, do not think all people are bad, but all are bad\nuntil they are saved or reborn. If you are not saved, you do not deserve a\nsafety net. To walk among the unsaved, you need a gun at all time in any space.\nPessimism often runs with paranoia and can give way to resentment and vindictive\npolicy where integrity and constitutional beliefs are too easily sacrificed to\npunish the other camp.</p>\n<p>Common sense says that the economy is more likely to grow under optimism than\npessimism, but what is the resource democrats draw their strength from and is it\ngeographically concentrated? Optimism is supported by the philosophical and\neconomic concept of the public good. Philosophically, the public good is rights\nlike the freedom of speech while economically it is resources like a properly\nfunded public school system. The concepts are seldom explicitly taught even\namong economic schools, but have been well outlined by thinkers like\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Unconscious-Civilization-John-Ralston-Saul/dp/0684871084/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1485716776&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;keywords=john+ralston+saul\">John Ralston Saul</a>.\nDue to the nature of the parties, blue states have more of it and red states\nless.</p>\n<p>Whether you practice or not, without even knowing it, we are first introduced to\nthe public good via religion. The stories of the Koran, the Bible, and the Torah\nall strive to codify the public good. When religions overlap to reveal universal\ntruths, that is the philosophical arm of the public good. Gandhi said all\nreligions are true because all religions strive to have a relationship with the\npublic good. If an ancient religious text seems dated and not to be taken\nliterally, that is because what is good is in flux and constantly needs\nprogressive revision and the removal of interests. Adamantly promoting an\noutdated, unreflected upon version of the public good to support an interest\ncreates pessimism.</p>\n<p>The next great codification of the public good (and recognition of its\nfragility) that we are exposed to is the United States Constitution. The\ndocument is set up to prevent erosion or deliberate destruction of the public\ngood by outlining checks and balances to government bodies as well as containing\na strong bill of rights. The document can also be officially amended to reflect\nthe public good so it does not become as easily dated as a religious text.</p>\n<p>But how does this all relate to the current divide within the country? Times of\nAmerican growth and prosperity have taken place during periods where a vast\nmajority have optimistically believed other people were inherently good without\nbeing hyper conscious of it. Prosperity has also coincided with policy that\nstrengthened the resources of the public good so that they could be drawn upon\nfor optimism.</p>\n<p>Economically, the public good is a vast network of resources holding immense\nhard to quantify wealth so it has become a major target for kleptocracy and\nlooting. The public good is hard to notice and outline so that it becomes hard\nto defend when it is stolen from such as the privatization of prisons or\nprivatization of essential services like fire departments. We are currently\nseeing efforts to privatize public schools which may be the public good’s single\ngreatest resource for optimism.</p>\n<p>It is important to recognize what should be public and what should be private\nand to understand the benefits of both because they feed each other and help us\nfind balance. Private for profit institutions can never have the full goals of\npublic institutions and therefore cannot generate the same optimism that drives\nprosperity. Public resources such as research are integral to business optimism\nand make it easier for competitive private enterprises to start and grow. Due to\nexternalities, production often has costs not factored into the price of a good.\nProtections from public institutions like the EPA create and maintain optimism\nby assuring the public will not foot the bill down the road for the accumulated\ndestructive behavior of a corporation.</p>\n<p>The pessimists have always been in this country, but they have never recently\nbeen so strong. Previously, pessimism was mainly the product of religion,\nparticularly fire and brimstone versions of Christianity, but atheists and\nagnostics also have to form a value system and need to see the public good to\nbecome optimists. Optimism is harder when you are geographically further away\nfrom the resources of the public good which is disproportionately concentrated\nin cities due to high population density.</p>\n<p>Numerous catalysts for pessimism exist and a very significant driver has been\nterrorism created by economic unrest in unstable regions that have very weak\npublic institutions and resources. The priest sex abuse scandals have also been\nvery significant in destroying trust in a large institution that, whether you\nare religious or not, still plays a large role in the public good. McLuhan-esque\nchanges to media have also weakened optimism and challenged the resolve of all\nour public resources. Social media is more like algorithmic media and nth degree\nnegative stories get promoted to the fore generating pessimism and paranoia. Due\nto the algorithmic promotion of stories, many people believe crime is increasing\nwhile in actuality statistics show it to be decreasing.</p>\n<p>Optimism and pessimism profoundly impacts policing. Who is more likely to shoot\nan unarmed black man pulled over for a simple traffic violation, an officer that\nbelieves people are inherently good or an officer that believes people are\ninherently bad? Proper funding for public institutions like police departments\nare integral to maintaining the public good which carries optimism. The funding\nfor these institutions has been ravaged by globalism via the inability to raise\ntaxes. The source of funding changes a municipal police department’s place in\nthe public good. Forcing officers to fund themselves from one by one ticketing\ncreates downward spiral of pessimism with consequences of series social unrest.</p>\n<p>Gun rights can be looked at in the context of the inherently good or bad\nconstruct. Citizens successfully move about coastal cities with optimism not\ncarrying guns by holding the belief other people are inherently good while many\nrural dwellers (to pick a category name) do not believe they can visit the city\nwithout a gun. They believe people are inherently bad, or work on a sliding\nscale where some easy to recognize people are inherently bad. To hold an <em>other</em>\nsaved, they have to be vetted personally.</p>\n<p>Coastal cities benefit economically from an upward spiral of optimism generated\nby creativity that results from pursuing diversity and inclusion. This is all\nmade possible by believing people are inherently good. Strong optimism\ncorrelated to key features of the public good helps coastal cities to easily\nweather storms that directly effect their locals such as terror attacks in New\nYork or Boston. Distant pessimist locals are disproportionately shook despite\ntheir distant location.</p>\n<p>The current GOP, believing people are inherently bad, is a dead end and cannot\ncreate optimism once they take power. The economic arm of public good holds\nimmense wealth and instead of keeping size in check, while recognizing its\nimportance, ideology has taken hold with a goal of destroying any optimism\nsupporting public good not tied down. Private business growth within GOP\nideology comes from the looting of the public good. Public institutions that\nshould remain public are privatized and protections are removed which create\nexternalities that will have to be paid for later by the public. Current GOP\npolicy does not create original prosperity, but rather only a transfer from the\npublic good to private hands.</p>\n<p>This inherently good versus bad, optimism versus pessimism construct lies\nbeneath the rhetoric and hopefully is helpful to put a finger on exactly how we\ndiffer within this divided country. The relation of the public good to optimism\nand its associated prosperity hopefully can constructively guide policy to\nnarrowing the divide. Rural areas need the resources of the public good that\nurban areas have been able to draw from if they are to conquer their pessimism.\nBelieving people are inherently good is a hard road to walk and there will be\nbruising if not scares, but it is the true American way and path to sustained\nprosperity.</p>\n<aside>\n  <em>\n    Stephen is a self-taught beverage technologist and technical historian.\n    <br>\n    This article originally published at\n    <a href=\"https://www.bostonapothecary.com/optimism-is-your-weapon-inherently-good-and-the-public-good/\"\n      rel=\"nofollow\">Boston Apothecary</a>\n    on January 30, 2017.\n  </em>\n</aside>\n","slug":"2017-01-30-optimism-is-your-weapon"}},"__N_SSG":true}
