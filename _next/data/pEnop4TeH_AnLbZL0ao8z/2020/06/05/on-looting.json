The very act of\nlooting is resistance to the celebrity status of these commodities and what they\nimply: inanimate objects celebrated for the image, status, and privilege they\ncreate, and the way that privilege is assumed to confer the protection of the\npolice, the army, and other forms of the states monopoly on armed violence.</p>\n<p>What is the police? They are the active guards of the commodity, those dead\nobjects created by the labor of underpaid and exploited workers—the police have\nthe job to ensure that the products of this exploited labor remains a commodity.\nThese commodities have the magical property that these objects must be paid for,\ninstead of remaining mere passive and inanimate objects (sneakers, fancy\nwatches, iPhones &#x26; Teslas) that could be subject to anyone who comes along to\nmake use of them.</p>\n<p>In rejecting the humiliation of being subjected to the police, looters are at\nthe same time rejecting the humiliation of being subjected to the\nmedia-celebration and glorification of these dead objects (most often produced\nduring the exploitation of their own labor) into commodities.</p>\n<p>Looting, in other terms, is both a rejection of the commodity and the violence\nused to protect its spectacular status, and a Peoples Bailout by other means.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<cite class=\"hanging-indent\">\n  Debord, G.
