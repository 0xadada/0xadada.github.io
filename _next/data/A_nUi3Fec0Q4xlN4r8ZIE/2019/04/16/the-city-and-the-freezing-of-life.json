This is one reason why so many garage startups and\ngarage bands and artists spilling paint in discarded warehouse lofts have\nleft their mark on the world. The true creative class can’t afford to\nrent expensive new studios.”</p>\n<figcaption>\n  &mdash;\n  Michael Gibson,\n  <cite>\n    <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/san-francisco-decline-failed-government-policies/\" rel=\"external\">\n      San Francisco’s Slow-Motion Suicide</a>\n  </cite>\n</figcaption>\n</blockquote>\n<p>{: cite=\"<a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/san-francisco-decline-failed-government-policies/\">https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/san-francisco-decline-failed-government-policies/</a>\" }</p>\n<p>Gibson alludes to the conservative zoning laws and wealthy property owners\nexacerbating the plight of San Francisco and similar cities: Owners want\nproperty values to rise above all other concerns. The problem in San Francisco\nisn't a lack of development, but the opposite: The lack of LIFE itself. San\nFrancisco has privileged the physical static object of the real-estate-object\nover the use of space in time. The people owning property and businesses\nprivilege the real estate value over use value, and the result is a static dead\nspace where object-value dominates and eliminates the use of space for daily\nlife.</p>\n<p>Recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/b_apothecary\">a friend of mine</a> packed his\nmotorcycle up with his distillation laboratory, plastic molding equipment,\nmachine shop tools, his immense library, his formidable liquor collection, and\nmoved down to Philadelphia, where he can have a far larger living space,\nworkspaces are abundantly available, and where the barrier to start new\nbusinesses and develop existing vacant lots for new uses are minimal or\nnon-existent.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2019-04-16-gentrification.jpg\" alt=\"Gentrified Architecture\" title=\"Gentrified Architecture\">\n  <figcaption>\n    An example of \"Gentrified Architecture\" \n    <br>\n    Photo by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gentrified_architecture_in_Shaw_Neighborhood,_Washington,_DC_USA.jpg\">Ted Eytan</a> \n    <br>\n    It is as obliterating as it is banal because\n    it does not modify or build from an existing architectural tradition of an area,\n    but rather changes it completely. It subtly shifts collective perceptions of\n    formerly \"working class\" areas to abide by the homogenizing effects of global\n    capitalism and disconnects the area from the social histories in which it\n    exists.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The drive to urbanization is an imperative of capitalism, this drive results in\n<q>a freezing of life</q>— a static world devoid of spontaneity, the result of land\ndevelopment and bureaucratic zoning laws optimized for rent seeking and\nincreased land valuations, devoid of nature and where its residents have no\nability to change their surroundings to suit daily life. All desire for change\nis eliminated in order to serve the profit generating imperative of capital, all\nautonomy of local residential use is therefore foreclosed, instead privileging\nreal estate development as the only legitimate use.</p>\n<p>The result of this is a predominance of land organized around the valuable\nplacement of real estate objects over the living use and alteration of land by\nthe very people who live in these spaces, people who wish to change their\nsurroundings over time as use-patterns and ways of living change with the\nseasons and with time. The philosopher Hegel explored this concept saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Space is the connection of the quiescent asunderness and side-by-sideness of\nthings [objects]; Time is the connection of their vanishing or alteration...\nIn the spatial world the question is not succession but of coexistence... As a\nrestless Becoming [Time] is not an element of the synthetic whole.”</p>\n<figcaption>\n  &mdash;\n  G.W.F. Hegel,\n  <cite>The Philosophical Propadeutic</cite>\n</figcaption>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is to say: the privileging of objects in space fetishizes the object and\ntherefore sacrifices changes in time. This creates an\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentrified_architecture\">alienated and static space of purely fetishized structures</a>,\ndevoid of life.</p>\n<p><em>This was an excerpt from \"The Society of The Spectacle\" a\nforthcoming translation of Guy Debord, translated by 0xADADA.</em></p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<cite class=\"hanging-indent\">\nDebord, Guy.
