It\nis, for all intents and purposes, the camera that captures your soul.\n<strong>Facebook’s business is to simulate you and to own and control your simulation,\nthereby owning and controlling you.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Where Mark asks you to trust him to be a benevolent king, I say let us build a\nworld without kings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I call the business model of Facebook, Google, and the venture-capital-funded\nlong tail of Silicon Valley startups “people farming”. Facebook is a factory\nfarm for human beings. And Mark’s manifesto is nothing more than a panicked\nbillionaire’s latest sophomoric attempt to decorate an unpalatable business\nmodel grounded in the abuse of human rights with faux moral purpose to stave off\nregulation and justify what is unabashedly a colonial desire: to create a global\nfiefdom by connecting all of us to Facebook, Inc.</p>\n<h2>Avoiding a Global Colony</h2>\n<p>Mark’s manifesto isn’t about building a global community, it is about building a\nglobal colony – with himself as king and with his corporation and the Silicon\nValley oligarchy as the court.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Facebook wants us to think that it is a park when it’s actually a shopping\nmall.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is not the job of a corporation to “develop the social infrastructure for\ncommunity” as Mark wants to do. Social infrastructure must belong to the\ncommons, not to giant monopolistic corporations like Facebook. The reason we\nfind ourselves in this mess with ubiquitous surveillance, filter bubbles, and\nfake news (propaganda) is precisely due to the utter and complete destruction of\nthe public sphere by an oligopoly of private infrastructure that poses as public\nspace.</p>\n<p>Facebook wants us to think that it is a park when it’s actually a shopping mall.\nThe last thing we need is more privately owned centralised digital\ninfrastructure to solve the problems created by an unprecedented concentration\nof power, wealth, and control in a tiny number of hands. It’s way past time we\nstarted funding and building the digital equivalents of parks in the digital age\ninstead of building ever-larger shopping malls.</p>\n<p>Others have written\n<a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/17/zuckerberg_publishes_worldsaving_manifesto/\" title=\"The Register: Zuckerberg thinks he&#x27;s cyber-Jesus – and publishes a 6,000-word world-saving manifesto\">detailed critiques</a>\nof Mark’s manifesto. I will not repeat their efforts here. Instead, I want to\nfocus on how we can build a world that stands in stark contrast to the one in\nMark’s vision. A world in which we – individuals – instead of corporations, have\nownership and control of our selves. In other words, where we have <em>individual\nsovereignty</em>.</p>\n<p>Where Mark asks you to trust him to be a benevolent king, I say let us build a\nworld without kings. Where Mark’s vision is rooted in colonialism and the\nperpetuation of centralised power and control, mine is based on individual\nsovereignty and a healthy, distributed commons.</p>\n<h2>Individual Sovereignty and the Cyborg Self</h2>\n<p>We can no longer afford the luxury of not understanding\n<a href=\"https://ar.al/notes/the-nature-of-the-self-in-the-digital-age/\" title=\"Aral Balkan: The Nature of the Self in the Digital Age\">the nature of the self in the digital age</a>.\nThe very existence of our freedoms and democracy depend on it.</p>\n<p>We are (and we have been for a while now) cyborgs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We must resist any attempt to reduce people to property with the greatest of\nfervour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In that, I don’t mean to conjure up the stereotypical representation of cyborgs\nas prevalent in science fiction wherein technology is implanted within\nbiological tissue. Instead, I offer a more general definition in which the term\napplies to any extension of our minds and our biological selves using\ntechnology. While technological implants are certainly feasible, possible, and\ndemonstrable, the main way in which we extend ourselves with technology today is\nnot through implants but <em>explants</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>We are sharded beings</strong>; the sum total of our various aspects as contained\nwithin our biological beings as well as the myriad of technologies that we use\nto extend our biological abilities.</p>\n<p>Once we understand this, it follows that we must extend the protections of the\nself beyond our biological borders to encompass those technologies by which we\nextend our selves. Wherefore, any attempt to own, control, and trade in these\ntechnologies by third parties is an attempt to own, control, and trade in the\nconstitutional elements of people. It is, in short, an attempt to own, control,\nand trade in people.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, we must resist any attempt to reduce people to property with\nthe greatest of fervour. For to not do so is to give our tacit consent to a new\nslavery: one in which we do not trade in the biological aspects of human beings\nbut their digital aspects. The two, of course, do not exist apart and are not\ntruly separable when manipulation of one necessarily affects the other.</p>\n<h2>Beyond Surveillance Capitalism</h2>\n<p>Once we understand that our relationship to technology is not one of\nmaster/butler but cyborg/organ; once we understand that we extend our selves\nwith technology and that our technology and data lie within the boundaries of\nthe self, then we must insist that the constitutional protections of the self\nthat we have enshrined within the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\nimplemented within our myriad of national laws are extended to protect the\ncyborg self.</p>\n<p>It also follows, then, that any attempt to violate the boundaries of the self\nmust be considered an assault on the cyborg self. It is exactly this abuse that\nconstitutes the everyday business model of Facebook, Google, and mainstream\nSilicon Valley-inspired technology today. In this model, which Shoshana Zuboff\ncalls\n<a href=\"http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshana-zuboff-secrets-of-surveillance-capitalism-14103616.html\" title=\"Shoshana Zuboff: Surveillance Capitalism\">surveillance capitalism</a>,\nwhat we have lost is individual sovereignty. People have once again become\nproperty – albeit in digital, not biological, form.</p>\n<p>To counter this, we must build new infrastructure to enable people to regain\nindividual sovereignty. Those aspects of the infrastructure that concern the\nworld around us must belong to the commons and those parts that concern people –\nthat make up the organs of our cyborg selves – must be owned and controlled by\nindividuals.</p>\n<p>So, for example, smart city architecture must be in the commons and data about\nthe world around us (“data about rocks”) must belong to the commons, while your\nsmart car, smart phone, smart watch, smart teddy bear, etc., and the data they\ncollect (“data about people”) must belong to you.</p>\n<h2>An Internet of people</h2>\n<p>Imagine a world where everyone has their own space on the Internet, funded from\nthe commons. This is a private space (an organ of the cyborg self) that all our\nso-called smart devices (also organs) link into.</p>\n<p>Instead of thinking of this space as a personal cloud, we must consider it a\nspecial, permanent node within a peer-to-peer structure wherein all our various\ndevices (organs) connect to one another. Pragmatically, this permanent node is\nused to guarantee findability (initially using domain names) and availability\n(as it is hosted/always on) as we transition from the client/server architecture\nof the current Web to the peer-to-peer architecture of the next generation\nInternet.</p>\n<p>The infrastructure we build must be funded from the commons, belong to the\ncommons, and be interoperable. The services themselves must be constructed and\nhosted by a plethora of individual organisations – not governments or corporate\nbehemoths – working with interoperable protocols and competing to provide the\nbest service possible to the people they serve. Not coincidentally, this\nseverely limited scope of corporate function marks the entirety of a\ncorporation’s role within a democracy as I see it.</p>\n<p>The sole purpose of a corporation should be to compete with other organisations\nto provide the best service to the people it serves. This is in stark contrast\nto the wide remit corporations have today to attract people (whom they call\n“users”) under false pretences (free services wherein they are the product being\nsold) only to addict them, entrap them with lock-in using proprietary\ntechnology, farm them, manipulate their behaviour, and exploit them for\nfinancial and political gain.</p>\n<p>In the corporatocracy of today, we – individuals – serve corporations. In the\ndemocracy of tomorrow, corporations must serve us.</p>\n<p>The service providers must, of course, be free to extend the capabilities of the\nsystem as long as they share their improvements back into the commons (“share\nalike”), thus avoiding lock-in. For providing services above and beyond the core\nservices funded from the commons, individual organisations may set prices for\nand charge for value-added services. In this way, we can build a healthy economy\nof competition on top of an ethically sound core instead of the system of\nmonopolies we have today on top of an ethically rotten core. And we can do so\nwithout embroiling the whole system in convoluted government bureaucracy that\nwould stifle experimentation, competition, and the organic, decentralised\nevolution of the system.</p>\n<p>Interoperability, free (as in freedom) technology with “share alike” licenses, a\npeer-to-peer architecture (as opposed to client/server), and a commons-funded\ncore are the fundamental safeguards for preventing this new system from decaying\ninto a new version of the monopolistic surveillance web we have today. They are\nhow we avoid economies of scale and break the feedback loop between the\naccumulation of information and wealth that is the core driver of surveillance\ncapitalism.</p>\n<p>To be perfectly clear, we are not talking about a system that can flourish under\nthe dictates of late-stage surveillance capitalism. It is a system, however,\nthat can be constructed under present conditions to act as the bridge from that\nstatus quo to a sustainable, post-capitalist world.</p>\n<h2>Building the world you want to live in</h2>\n<p>In a talk I gave at a European Commission event in Rome recently, I told the\naudience that we must “build the world we want to live in.” For me, that is not\na world owned and controlled by a handful of Silicon Valley oligarchs. It is a\nworld with a healthy commons wherein we – as a community – collectively own and\ncontrol those aspects of our existence that belong to us all and where we – as\nindividuals – individually own and control those aspects of our existence that\nbelong to our selves.</p>\n<p>Imagine a world where you (and those you love) have democratic agency; where we\nall enjoy basic welfare, rights, and freedoms befitting cyborg dignity. Imagine\na sustainable world freed of the destructive short-term greed of capitalism\nwhere we no longer reward sociopaths for finding ever more ruthless and\ndestructive ways to accumulate wealth and power at the expense of everyone else.\nImagine a free world removed from the feedback loop of manufactured fear and\nubiquitous surveillance that has us spiralling deeper into a fresh vortex of\nfascism. Imagine a world where we grant ourselves the mercy of an intellectually\nrewarding existence where we are free to explore the potential of our species\namong the stars.</p>\n<p>That is the world that I wake up every day to work towards. Not because it is\ncharitable. Not because I’m a philanthropist. In fact, for no reason at all\nother than because that is the world that I want to live in.</p>\n<aside>\n  <em>\n    Aral Balkan is an activist, designer, and developer.
