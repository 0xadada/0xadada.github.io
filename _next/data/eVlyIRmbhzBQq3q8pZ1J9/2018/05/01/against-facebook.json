The death of idleness.</em></p>\n<p>This essay explores the ways Facebook transforms our attention into a product,\nand how that transformation changes us. It then proposes a social media strike\nas a concrete strategy to reclaim our attention, and finally lists many reasons\nwhy we should all quit Facebook.</p>\n<h2>The Commodification of Microwork</h2>\n<p>Social media companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Snapchat have created\na marketplace for our attention, where we become the product sold to advertisers\nwho subtly change our behavior to buy products and services for their own\nbenefit. This type of persuasion is most effective when these platforms command\nour attention with a heightened level of distraction. We create the content that\nis then used to command the attention of our peers, which is then used to sell\nadvertising space while the surrounding content is measured for engagement, and\nthe results are analyzed to optimize the next round of ad placement. This\nprocess is the commodification of microwork— the seemingly small tasks that we\nare compelled to do by force of habit, tasks that aren't in our own interests\nbut in the interests of the platforms and advertisers using our attention and\ntime to pad their bottom lines. Also known as “heteromation” (Ekbia, Nardi,\n2014), microwork includes reading timelines, posting photos &#x26; updates, liking,\nretweeting, and generally dedicating our time, attention, and emotions to these\nplatforms—each tiny action its own form of labor, given over freely to the\nadvertisers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The new media of surveillance capitalism solicit social behaviors, monitor\nthose behaviors, map social interactions, and resell what they learn to\nadvertisers and others.” <cite>(Turner, 2017)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Platforms like Facebook are attempting to create systems for the generation of\ndistraction, Crary describes it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“conditions that individuate, immobilize, and separate subjects, even within a\nworld in which mobility and circulation are ubiquitous. In this way attention\nbecomes key to the operation of noncoercive forms of power” <cite>(Crary,\n2001, pg. 74)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over time, these systems continually push our attention and distraction to new\nlimits and thresholds. Youtube &#x26; Netflix discovers that auto-playing the next\nrelated video dramatically increases views (Bridle, 2017); Twitter uses the\n\"pull-to-refresh\" UI gesture that leverages variable rewards to trigger\naddictive behavior as a way to increase user engagement with the timeline;\nFacebook uses the “red dot” notifications that keep people checking their phone\nfor the next new thing. These gadgets are designed to create a “supernormal\nstimulus,” that is, a stimulus that produces a stronger than natural response.\nWe can even internalize the supernormal stimulus—an example is the \"phantom\nvibrate\" we sometimes feel in our pocket when no vibration occurs. In the case\nof social media, the supernormal stimulus is used to exploit our response to\nnovelty in order to elicit a behavior that works in the interests of the social\nmedia provider.</p>\n<p>This eventually leads to a crisis of attentiveness, where the system must\nmaintain an increased level of distraction. In order to continually distract us,\nthe visual landscape must constantly change, requiring us to reorient our\nattention until the shift from one thing to another becomes the natural state\n(e.g. the Instagram “Explore” tab). Over time, we begin to value our attention\nwhile the platforms struggle to get more and more of what they previously got\nfor free. This is not sustainable, as newer products need to continually\nrevolutionize the means of distraction or else we will realize how distracted we\nreally are. With a loss of distraction, we can more easily achieve self\nactualization.</p>\n<p>This process of commodification has turned us all into tastemakers, reviewers,\nlikers, retweeters and brand ambassadors. The platform takes our real authentic\nfriendships and first commodifies them,\nreifies them, and then sells them back to us as an “image of friendship”, but\none that is bankrupt of any genuine social value. Over time, these platforms\ntransform us all into unpaid advertising agencies. We promote goods, services,\nlifestyles and desires to our friends, weaponizing images to generate feelings\nof jealousy and FOMO amongst our peers during those idle moments when they feel\nmost bored. These idle moments are when we are most vulnerable, and thus we’re\npsychologically primed to accept the supernormal stimulus. The platform\ncapitalizes on this vulnerability, and over time begins to redefine what we once\nconsidered “real” friendship into a relationship with the platform itself,\nmediated by the features and “images of friendship” within it through Liked and\nRetweeted posts, Snapchat streaks, Follow requests, posted text, images or even\nhow we reduce our emotions into a series of emoji (Smith, 2016).</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2018-05-01-facebook-spectacle-graph.svg\"\n    alt=\"The process of commodification\" title=\"The process of commodification\">\n  <figcaption>The process of commodification</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In this way, the platform is able to monetize our friendships, tastes, opinions,\nand even our emotions. Our internal thoughts and experiences become\ncommodifiable assets, measured as engagements to be analyzed, A-B tested,\noptimized and charted, then touted by executives in PowerPoint presentations at\nboard meetings. Our experiences are mined, packaged, and sold, and we are not\npaid a dime.</p>\n<p>Instead of blindly activating our social media habit for that quick dopamine\nfix, consider who actually benefits. Are you performing a microwork task for\nFacebook or Snapchat? If so, then why aren't you being paid?</p>\n<h2>What They Say vs What They Do</h2>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2018-05-01-facebook-spectacle.jpg\"\n    alt=\"The Society of the Facebook\" title=\"The Society of the Facebook\">\n  <figcaption>The Society of the Facebook</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Newspapers, cable news, and social media platforms are trying to turn us all\ninto media addicts. These businesses rely on persuading us to consume more and\nmore (keyword: “increase engagement”) in order to curate an “interest in current\naffairs” (e.g. New York Times) or to “build meaningful and connected\nrelationships with our community” (e.g. Facebook.)</p>\n<p>The reality of the media, however, is driven by a simple business rule: Sell\nwhat sells best, the supernormal stimuli: whether it’s clickbait, memes, curated\nlifestyles, celebrity gossip, salacious headlines, and freak events. The media\ntends to focus on the rare incidents that have no actual influence on our daily\nlives, and the goal of these platforms is to keep us addicted. Facebook’s 2017\nAnnual Report makes it clear:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their\nengagement and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on\nNews Feed, partially offset by increasing user engagement with video content\nand other product changes. <cite>(Facebook, 2017)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We think we’re immune to the persuasiveness of advertising, but remember,\nadvertising is a $600 billion dollar industry that is the financial basis of\nthe tech sector. The massive profits these companies have built have been done\nso on the backs of advertising campaigns.</p>\n<p>Facebook’s (and Google’s, etc.) real agenda is to display and sell ads—not to\nhelp people “build meaningful and connected relationships.” At no point was this\nmore clear than during Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony before Congress. When Senator\nHatch asked him, “How do you sustain a business model in which people don’t pay\nfor your service?” his response was as straightforward as it could’ve been:\n“Senator, we run ads.” (NBC News, 2018).</p>\n<figure><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n2H8wx1aBiQ?rel=0&amp;controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></iframe>\n <figcaption>Senator, we run ads.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>“Building Relationships” is the rationale used in order to serve the\nadvertisements, but the advertisements themselves are the real content of these\nplatforms. The business arrangement of the platform is a simple one: ads are the\ncontent, the advertisers are the clients, the user doing microwork tasks are the\nworkers, and <em>our future behaviors are the product</em>.</p>\n<p>As a result, we end up building relationships to the platform—not to each other.</p>\n<p>Through the investment of our attention, we allow the commodities and ideologies\nof the platform to bombard our unconscious and subtly shape our behavior. The\nprocess of \"exchanging time for image, provides the counterflow to the moving\nimage and as advertising revenues would indicate, is itself productive of\nvalue.\" (Beller 2006, p.79)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Facebook’s nearly one billion users have become the largest unpaid workforce\nin history\" <cite>(Laney, 2012)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The intended effect the media wishes to create is media-driven neuroticism—a\nlove of change for its own sake, or neomania, a love of new things. Ultimately,\nneomania together with the media has a negative effect on our moods, which isn’t\nsurprising considering most of what makes the daily news is negative. This\nleaves us feeling powerless, like the world is falling apart. So we turn to\nsocial media to witness the (seemingly) beautiful lives of celebrities, and the\nromantic and exciting lives of our friends and family. But this ends up driving\nthe compulsion to compare our own lives with those of the people we see on\nsocial media, creating feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, and jealousy. These\nfeelings are misguided however, since the lives we see in the media and social\nplatforms are a tightly edited and curated spectacle of people presenting an\n<em>image of how they want to appear, not of how they actually are.</em></p>\n<h2>Practical Defense Against Unpaid Microwork</h2>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2018-04-24-against-facebook.jpg\"\n    alt=\"News Feed, by Beeple\" title=\"News Feed, by Beeple\">\n  <figcaption>\n    <a href=\"https://www.artstation.com/artwork/6VW95\" title=\"News Feed\">\"News\n      Feed\"</a>,\n    by Beeple.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Today it's popular to hear about the media detox or a social media diet. The\nconcept is often framed as a metaphor for eating and weight loss. We can extend\nthis metaphor to consider the microwork tasks we find ourselves doing on a daily\nbasis. Are the habits and media and we consume daily like the healthy foods that\nwe can use to build a healthy mind and body? Or will they ultimately poison us?\nTo live a healthy life we should moderate our media consumption the same way we\ndo with the things we eat.</p>\n<p>The toxicity of the media can be understood as a signal-to-noise problem. The\nmore media we consume, the more noise we get (rather than the valuable part,\ncalled the signal.) If we consume the news on a yearly basis (in the form of\nbooks), we can assume about half of what we consume is signal, and the rest\nnoise (randomness). If we increase our frequency to a daily intake, the\ncomposition would increase to about 95% noise, and only 5% signal. If we\nincrease our intake to an hourly frequency (as those who follow the stock market\nor heavy social media users do) the composition increases to 99.5% noise and\n0.5% signal. This is roughly 200% more noise than signal, more toxic noise to\nboth misdirect and distract, and has negative effects on our mood.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Distraction could be described as a phenomenon in which you connect,\ninadvertently or absentmindedly, to more things than you intended. The noise\ndrowns out the signal. <cite>(Solnit, 2018)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A practical approach for a healthy relationship with the media we consume is to\ncreate distance between ourselves and the media that surrounds us on a daily\nbasis. Distance creates an opportunity to gain new perspectives on the media\n(and life in general). This distance reduces the influence of these platforms,\nand creates a space for our ideas and imagination to flourish.</p>\n<p>Idleness and imagination are essential to our wellbeing, they’re the wellspring\nof mental clarity, and the backstop for memory. Take a few minutes each day to\ncultivate idleness and some mental space. Step away from the hourly, daily,\nweekly media cycle, and read books instead. Books benefit from the perspective\nof time, which results in more settled and established facts with increased\ndepth of analysis. If our goal is to have a wider perspective, and a balanced\nunderstanding of the major forces at work in the world, our best bet is to read\n<em>good</em> books.</p>\n<p>This essay gives us the task of avoiding contact with the mundane, cheap, and\nephemeral media that surrounds us on a daily basis; to avoid having our\nattention distracted, redirected, exploited, and abused against our own\ninterests. We should ignore those things that bring no happiness or value to our\nlives. Instead, we should focus our attention on our imagination, quality\nthought, friends and family, idleness; on things that matter. We should explore\neffective ways to reclaim clarity of thought, and autonomy of attention.</p>\n<p>The task is to change the very way we attend the world around us. Henry David\nThoreau described a similar mental recalibration in <em>Life Without Principle</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we have thus desecrated ourselves, — as who has not? — the remedy will be\nby wariness and devotion to reconsecrate ourselves, and make once more a fane\nof the mind. <em>We should treat our minds, that is, ourselves, as innocent and\ningenuous children, whose guardians we are, and be careful what objects and\nwhat subjects we thrust on their attention.</em> Read not the Times. Read the\nEternities. <cite>(Thoreau, 1863)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This essay proposes the <em>survivorship</em> bias as the criteria to determine which\nmedia to ignore as mundane, cheap, and ephemeral. Survivorship sets the focus on\nknowledge that has withstood the test of time; Nicholas Taleb makes the\nfollowing recommendation in <em>Antifragile</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“[read] as little as feasible from the last twenty years, except history books\nthat are not about the last fifty years. [...what most people do] is read\ntimely material that becomes instantly obsolete. (Taleb, 2012)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Aaron Swartz had similar sentiments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Its obsession with the criminal and the deviant makes us less trusting people.\nIts obsession with the hurry of the day-to-day makes us less reflective\nthinkers. Its obsession with surfaces makes us shallow.\n<cite>(Swartz, 2006)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Survivorship is a simple heuristic with which to judge media, be it books, news,\nsocial media, television, academic journal articles or even video games. A\nclickbait article can go viral and get millions of views the first day it's\npublished, but according to the survivorship bias, its newness means that it’s\nlikely to be obsolete the next day. Rather than trying to judge for yourself if\nmedia is worth your attention, try letting the survivorship bias do the work for\nyou.</p>\n<p>The survivorship bias has a few knock-on effects that are worth mentioning.\nMedia tends to be discounted as it ages. Video games are always on sale a few\nmonths and especially years after they’ve been released; Books and movies are\nalways cheaper well after their release as well; Newspapers are free the day\nafter they were published; and so on. Beyond saving our attention from instantly\nobsolete media, we will also be saving money simply by waiting long enough. With\ntime also comes more in-depth analysis from the surrounding community; reviews\nand deep interpretations of the rich meaning behind film and video games benefit\nfrom the additional time it takes for this analysis to blossom. This cultural\nanalysis isn’t available to those following the cult-of-the-new.</p>\n<h2>Media Consumption Strike</h2>\n<p>Now that we understand how the territory of our attention has been colonized, we\ncan begin to resist. Our challenge is to put the following strategies in\npractice until they form new habits that encourage idleness and mental\nspaciousness. We have the tools to reclaim our time and imaginations, we must\ntake action!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The inadvertent laboring towards the propagation of the spectacle is another\nexample of the ways that the spectacle takes advantage of its subordination of\nthe masses. It is a process to which they have no control other than to\nrenounce image culture completely which in a hyperreal world is almost\ninconceivable. <cite>(Berthelot, 2013)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Any efforts to reform the practices that produce the addictive symptoms of the\nattention economy will fail to address the underlying structures of late\ncapitalism that created these markets—namely, market fundamentalism, technologic\ndeterminism, deregulation, and privatization (Tanner, 2018).</p>\n<p>Given that; we propose a collective media consumption strike, and rather than\nallowing our attention to be driven by these platforms, we must direct our\nattention to the things that matter to us.</p>\n<p>The rules can be simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No advertising-sponsored TV or Youtube</li>\n<li>No commercial radio, news, or news aggregation</li>\n<li>No commercial social media, delete your Facebook account</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is not a holier-than-thou asceticism, but a refusal to have our attention\ndestroyed and exploited. Don’t be a fundamentalist about the rules. Rules are\nmeant to be broken. If it’s art, the rules are more loose; if it’s corporate\nmedia, more strict. Cinema, literature, sci-fi, comic books, indie games (or\nboard games): as long as these types of works are not connected with our\nprofessional, interpersonal, or political responsibilities, use them in\nmoderation. In general, make sure media consumption is done with more moderation\nthan usual. The goal is to break your habits.</p>\n<p>Many people work with computers for their job. Most aren’t privileged enough to\nbe able to completely disconnect from work. Work-related email, messaging, and\nwork-related browsing are out of scope for the strike by necessity—but do please\ntry to prevent any non-work related web browsing or media consumption. Don’t use\nwork as an excuse to view social media or browse the web. Academic journal\narticles and the like will be hard to avoid, but ask yourself if they would pass\nthe survivorship bias after a few years.</p>\n<p>Enable Do Not Disturb on your phone. This will establish designated mental space\nfor ourselves, friends, and family. Most smartphones have rules that can\nautomatically put the device into Do Not Disturb mode at set times. In Android\nand iOS, this is available by going to Settings and searching for Do Not Disturb\npreferences. Do Not Disturb is also available in macOS as well.</p>\n<p>Remove anything that provides <em>variable information rewards</em>. These are features\nin apps and games designed to give a random, pleasant surprise—to create\naddiction. Slot machines are designed to do this; social media platforms like\nFacebook, Twitter, and video games like Candy Crush use “loot crates” to achieve\nthe same result. Email can operate similarly. Turn off the red Notification dot\non all your apps.</p>\n<p>Remove Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Slack, Instagram, Youtube and any other\ncommercial social media apps from your devices. This makes it tougher to have\ninstant access to these forms of media since it's not immediately at your\nfingertips. Don’t cheat and use the web interface. Disable notifications for any\napps that you keep. Turn off all lock screen notifications, this also improves\nprivacy. Remove any of the other chat apps from your smartphone: Snapchat,\nFacebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Mastodon, Viber. If our friends need to reach us,\nthey can text or call. We should be the masters of our own time, and our network\nof friends isn’t in control of our time. Our inbox isn’t the world’s way to add\nitems to our TODO list.</p>\n<p>Remove any Bookmarks or Recently Viewed sites from your browser to prevent\n1-click-away sites from distracting us. Some software like SelfControl will\nblock habitual sites for you. Reddit, BuzzFeed, Upworthy, Medium are great sites\nto block.</p>\n<p>Try to limit checking email to once a day. Set a schedule at a set time, and\nstick to it. Do the same for messaging. Set an auto-responder if that helps\nreduce anxiety.</p>\n<p>Tell your friends why you are leaving commercial social media, make it clear\nthat your reason to leave is political, and not because you're ignoring them.\nGive your friends a direct way of reaching you.</p>\n<p>The idea behind this practice is to stop the urge to immediately unlock our\nphone whenever we have idle time. Our idle time should be owned by us.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The net effect these platforms have on us is to alienate us from our very lives.\nInstead of focusing on what is valuable and good, we tend to focus on what we\nlack, or what we’re missing out on. If we divest ourselves from this tendency,\nignore the rare incidents and ephemeral content that has no actual relevance to\nour daily lives, the net effect is beneficial to our mind and spirit. The\nresulting autonomy of attention can allow us to connect to the people and\nenvironments around us, and reclaim our very imaginations.</p>\n<p><em>0xADADA is a software developer working for AI and web related startups in\nBoston; graduated from Northeastern University with degrees in Computer Science\nand Cognitive Psychology. 0xADADAs' Facebook account was created in 2004 and\ndeleted in 2015.</em></p>\n<h2>Appendix: Reasons to Quit Facebook</h2>\n<p>The ideological rationale that keeps platforms like Facebook profiting from the\ncommodification of our attention and the collection of our private data lacks\ncommon courtesy at best, and is psychopathic at worst.

(Nunez,\n2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook can use your name and photo to endorse products and services to your\nsocial network without your knowledge. (Tucker, 2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook is the television of the web, letting us passively scroll through\ncontent that we'd probably like, based on our habits and things we've already\nLiked, putting us in comfort bubbles that are more isolating than physical\nwalls. (Derakhshan, 2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook creates an illusion of choice, but by shaping the menus we pick from,\nit hijacks the way we perceive our choices and replaces them with new ones that\naren’t in our best interests but serve the interests of Facebook. (Harris,\n2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook Likes, status updates, and pages we visit are \"more reliable\" in\npredicting mental illness. (Reynolds, 2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook uses intermittent variable rewards, used in slot machines to maximize\naddictiveness, by linking an action we take (pull-to-refresh) and a random\nreward (e.g. new posts!). (Harris, 2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook convinces us that we're missing out on something important, when in\nreality we’re not. (Harris, 2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook abuses our need for social approval, validation, and the need to belong\nin order to increase engagement. (Harris, 2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook abuses our need to reciprocate the social gestures of others. (E.g. the\nneed to Friend someone back who has Friended you). (Harris, 2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook abuses our attention with immediate interruptions because studies have\nshown it increases engagement. (Harris, 2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook abuses our intentions by hijacking our tasks with the needs of the\nplatform. For example, when you want to look up a Facebook event happening\ntonight, the app doesn't allow us to access the event without first redirecting\nus to the News feed. (Harris, 2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook makes it easy for us to handover self-incriminating data that can be\nused against us by law-enforcement. (Clark, 2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook blocked the account of activist Shaun King after he posted a racist\nemail that was sent to him. (Stallman, 2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook enforces a real name policy, allowing corporations and nation-states to\nbe able to connect users’ accounts with their real identity. This is dangerous\nfor marginalized people, and makes them vulnerable to blackmail lest their real\nidentities be exposed. The real name policy forces people to have a single\nidentity when in reality people have flexible identities that change depending\non social context. Using one’s real name inhibits one from experimenting with\nalternative identities, limiting personal growth to normative concepts of\nidentity. (Stallman, 2016).</p>\n<p>Facebook has censored posts for Israel, Russia, China, Turkey, the UK, and\nroutinely suppresses content for political reasons using algorithmic promotion\nand depromotion. (Stallman, 2016).</p>\n<p>On the web, hyperlinks are freely swapped to enable the cross-pollination of\ninformation and a diversity of decentralized ideas. On Facebook, each post\nexists unto itself, often accessible only within Facebook amongst ones “Friends\nof Friends”. “instead of seeing [hyperlinks] as a way to make that text richer.\nYou’re encouraged to post one single hyperlink and expose it to a\nquasi-democratic process of liking and plussing and hearting: Adding several\nlinks to a piece of text is not allowed. Hyperlinks are objectivized, isolated,\nstripped of their powers”. (Derakhshan, 2015).</p>\n<p>Facebook hurts the power of the website: “the Stream means you don’t need to\nopen so many websites any more. You don’t need numerous tabs. You don’t even\nneed a web browser. You open Twitter or Facebook on your smartphone and dive\ndeep in. The mountain has come to you. Algorithms have picked everything for\nyou. According to what you or your friends have read or seen before, they\npredict what you might like to see.” (Derakhshan, 2015).</p>\n<p>Facebook (even more so, Instagram) is the cul de sac of the internet. It’s where\ncontent can no longer be enriched with annotations external to itself. It’s\nwhere conversations wither and content goes to stare inwards at itself.</p>\n<p>Facebook analyzes the contents of messages sent between users on the platform to\nbetter target advertisements. (Virani, 2015).</p>\n<p>Facebook uses friends to gather additional information about us. Tagging friends\nin photos, answering questions about a friend’s marital status are ways we're\ntricked into snitching on our friends. (Virani, 2015).</p>\n<p>Facebook encourages us to present normative images of our lives, which results\nin alienation from the actual way we feel. (Krause, 2015).</p>\n<p>Increased use of Facebook is linked to depression. (Wald, 2015).</p>\n<p>Facebook’s internet.org project was touted to provide internet connected devices\nand networks in India, but created a Facebook-only view of the internet.\n(Burrington, 2015).</p>\n<p>Facebook abuses our innate tendencies to track our progress and assess our\nself-worth by comparing ourselves to other people. (Musser, 2015).</p>\n<p>Facebook photo data is used by Nashville company Facedeals to identify shoppers\nin stores with the stores’ own security cameras and facial recognition software.\nThese profiles are then used to increase purchase behavior using personalized\npromotions and deals. (Dormehl, 2014).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The problem with the web and its associated technologies is that it has made\nit so easy to share information about ourselves that doing so begins to feel\nlike an obligation, a sentence, a sisyphean curse; another day, another photo\nof lunch to post.\" <cite>(Beato, G.)</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Facebook manipulates our emotions with experiments on the News Feed. (Booth,\n2014).</p>\n<p>Facebook owns a patent for determining our location by identifying objects in\nour photos and videos based on neural networks of nearby images. (Facebook,\n2014).</p>\n<p>Facebook payments is tracking what you buy, and your financial information like\nbank account and credit card numbers. Facebook has already started sharing data\nwith Mastercard so they can drive online ad sales and determine credit\nworthiness from platform data. (Head, 2014).</p>\n<p>Facebook provided data to NSA as part of the PRISM program. (Greenwald, 2013).</p>\n<p>Facebook enables a surveillance apparatus where our every action could be\nmonitored, and since everyone technically violates some obscure law some of the\ntime, then punishment becomes selective and political. (Marlinspike, 2013).</p>\n<p>Facebook owns a patent that tracks and determines the types of physical\nactivities of a user based on movement of their device, including walking,\nrunning, cycling, driving, skiing, etc. (Facebook, 2013).</p>\n<p>Facebook owns a patent for determining our location using non-GPS data including\nnearby NFC, RFID, wifi, bluetooth signal, events in your calendar like\nrestaurant reservations or concerts. (Facebook, March 2013)</p>\n<p>Facebook sells profile data to credit card companies and insurance providers so\nthey can use platform data as indicators for credit and insurance risk. (Hawley,\n2012).</p>\n<p>Facebook makes it very difficult to quit, using social reciprocity and UX design\ndark patterns. (Brown, 2010).</p>\n<p>Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg hacked into Harvard Crimson editors’ private\nemail accounts. (Carlson, 2010).</p>\n<p>You should delete your Facebook account, but please share this essay before you\ndo 😉!</p>\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>I thank the following friends for their feedback:\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/agrabau\">Alex Grabau</a>,\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomdunn\">Thom Dunn</a>,\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/suzidao\">Suzi Dao</a>,\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/b_apothecary\">Stephen</a> &#x26;\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/qtychr\">qtychr</a>.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>Angwin, Julia.
