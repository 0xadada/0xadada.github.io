The car was built by DENT Sport Garage and\n<a href=\"http://www.germanperformanceservice.com/\">German Performance Service</a> in\nMassachusetts.</p>\n<p>The goal I established for the RASpec Impreza was a cross-campaign race car\ncapable of competing in time attack, time trial, hillclimb and wheel-to-wheel\nracing series up and down the East Coast.</p>\n<p>This car was originally purchased in 2004, and gradually transformed from street\ncar into full race car. The build was done iteratively informed from performance\nmetrics at races.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2015-08-15-raspec-impreza-exterior-front-left-01-far.jpg\" alt>\n  <figcaption>RASpec Impreza 2.0</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>2019 Update</h2>\n<p>This car is now owned and campaigned at Global Time Attack and other events by\n<a href=\"https://badpandamotorsports.com/\">Bad Panda Motorsports</a>.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2019-08-23-raspec-impreza-update.jpg\" alt>\n  <figcaption>\"Flexo\" (formerly the RASpec Impreza) v3.0</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Video</h2>\n<figure>\n    <iframe height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mciBcQ6PEAg\" \n      frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    <figcaption>RASpec Impreza 1.0 at Carolina Motorsports Park, SC.\n        Redline Time Attack.

Everything not welded to the\nchassis was removed, tagged and inspected. Anything not required for racing such\nas the interior and OEM suspension was sold. Anything worn was cataloged, and\nnew factory OEM replacements were ordered (such as chassis gommets and rubber\nwindow seals). The paint and rubberized under-body weatherproofing was removed\nby media-blasting and sanding. Next the chassis was fully seam-welded. Finally\nthe roll cage was built and the car was freshly painted white.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WEIGHT: 2762 lbs</li>\n<li>CAGE: SCCA multi-point rollcage</li>\n<li>CHASSIS: The entire chassis has been seam-welded</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.speedhunters.com/2022/10/your-cars-celebrating-the-subaru-impreza-wrx/#:~:text=2004%20subaru%20wrx%20sti%20type%20ra\">Speedhunters</a></p>\n<h2>Engine</h2>\n<p>The RASpec Impreza engine is a JDM EJ207 WRX STI 2-liter engine running the\n<a href=\"http://www.tomeiusa.com/_2003web-catalogue/efr_set-from_top-menu/efr_index-com-genesis.html\">Tomei 2.2l stroker kit</a>.\nThe Tomei 2.2l stroker kit was chosen as it is complete with pistons, rods and\nthe lightened, custom journaled crankshaft.

The bugeye was parted-out and stripped, and the build of my second\nrace car began. It was only fitting that it be called the \"RASpec Impreza 2.0\".</p>\n<p>The key features of the 2.0 version that were improvements over the 1.0 version\nwere as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fully stripped, media-blasted, caged and seam-welded chassis in order to\nreduce weight and increase rigidity</li>\n<li>Simplify turbo and intercooler setup to reduce maintenance and increase air\nflow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The resulting product of the build is a car that is lighter, faster and easier\nto maintain than the first race car. The \"RASpec Impreza 2.0\" is a better\noverall car, it takes the best aspects of the 1.0 and simplifies until there is\nnothing else to take away— creating a minimalist race-ready track\nplatform.</p>\n<h2>Significant Results</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>2006\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tt.comscc.org/ResultsModels/Event?EventID=63&#x26;ClassID=8\">COMSCC July - NHMS</a>\n<ul>\n<li>2nd Place - ST1 Street Touring 1 (of 5)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2007\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.comscc.org/events/results/view/?id=2007-final\">COMSCC Season Standings</a>\n<ul>\n<li>3rd place - ST2 Street Touring 2 (of 10)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>COMSCC June Mosport international Raceway\n<ul>\n<li>2nd Place - ST2 Street Touring 2 (of 3)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tt.comscc.org/ResultsModels/Event?EventID=72&#x26;ClassID=9\">COMSCC July - NHMS</a>\n<ul>\n<li>1st Place - ST2 Street Touring 2 (of 5)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2009\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tt.comscc.org/ResultsModels/Event?EventID=87&#x26;ClassID=6\">COMSCC July NHMS</a>\n<ul>\n<li>2nd Place - SPB Street Prepared B (of 5)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2010\n<ul>\n<li>Duryea Hillclimb - August\n<ul>\n<li>1st Place / 4th overall - Improved Touring E (of 103)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>What makes the car track-only?</em><br> Its a fully-built race car, so its been\nstripped to the bare essentials. This means no headlights, no wiper bottle, no\nseatbelts (harness only), no OEM seat brackets, no ODB-II.</li>\n<li><em>What does it need to go racing?</em><br> I would get new tires, bleed the brakes\nand adjust the alignment. Alignment should be set to your preferences for how\nyou like the car to turn-in and rotate. You may want to adjust the ride-height\nas well.</li>\n<li><em>How many track miles on it?</em><br> None. The chassis has 0 track miles on it,\nand the engine has been freshly rebuilt. The only \"time\" its seen is on the\ndyno while it was being tuned.</li>\n<li><em>Horsepower?</em><br> Currently it's running a conservative base map dialed for 350 wheel horse\npower at 20lbs of boost. This tune was done at\n<a href=\"http://www.synaptic3.com/\">Synaptic3 Performance</a> for a practice day where we\nwere focusing on suspension setup and were not racing. The previous tune made\n400whp at 23lbs of boost. On dyno testing its made much more at higher boost,\nbut we've dialed it back to increase engine longevity. Using the same engine\nparts, tolerances and turbo, Cusco / Tomei / Voltex made 500whp.</li>\n</ul>\n","slug":"2015-08-15-raspec-impreza","license":"cc-by-nc-sa"}},"__N_SSG":true}
