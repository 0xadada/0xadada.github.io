Fascism rallies to the\ndefense of the conservative bourgeois ideology of the family, private property,\nthe moral order, and patriotic nationalism. It unites the petty-bourgeois, the\nunemployed who have been hurt by the crisis or disappointed by the impotence of\nthe socialist revolution‒ it is not by its nature fundamentally ideological, but\nmay exhibit ideology to suit its needs. Its strength is how it presents itself\ntruthfully as a violent resurrection of mythic past origins‒ to claim the past\nas a “Golden Age” and a return to the success of this golden past. It demands\nparticipation in a community held together by mythical archaic pseudo-values:\nrace, blood, and the leader.</p>\n<p><em>Fascism is a cult of the archaic fitted out by modern technology.</em> It revives\nand recreates its myth (both past and present) through the spectacle using\nspeeches, television, radio, internet, and pop culture. It is a major factor in\nthe formation of the modern spectacle. The false mythology of this “Golden Age”\nis one of the fundamental factors of contemporary society, and was a primary\nfactor in the destruction of the workers movements of the past.</p>\n<p>Fascism however, is the most costly means of preserving a capitalist order due\nto the scale and effort required of the state to enforce the authoritarian rule\nof a minority with a police state apparatus. Fascism is unsustainable in the\nlong-term, and must be pushed aside by a more efficient and rational form of\npower; neoconservative or neoliberal representational democracy being typical\ncontemporary examples.</p>\n<p><em>This was an excerpt from \"The Society of The Spectacle\" a forthcoming new book\nby 0xADADA which reinterprets the original by Guy Debord.</em></p>\n<aside>\n  Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@alecfavale\">Alec Favale</a> on \n  <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/police\">Unsplash</a>\n</aside>\n<aside hidden>\n  This was also posted to\n  <a href=\"https://indieweb.xyz/en/socialtheory\" class=\"u-syndication\">/en/socialtheory</a>.\n</aside>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<cite class=\"hanging-indent\">\nDebord, G.
