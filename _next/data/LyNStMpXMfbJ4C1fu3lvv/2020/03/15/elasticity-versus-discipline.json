Currently, according\nto <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section14.htm\">Section 14</a> of the\nFederal Reserve Act, the Fed is prevented from buying assets (stocks, index\nfunds CDO, MBS)\ndirectly on the market. Instead they can only buy government-backed assets,\nmostly bonds and MBSs by institutions like Freddie Mac that <em>are</em> government\nbacked. Instead, the Feds first line of defense is lowering interest rates, and\nthen creating liquidity by buying long-term maturities.</p>\n<p>With the interest rates at zero, the biggest lever at the Fed is effectively\nbroken, and now they've got to find another lever. Last Friday (6 March), Boston\nFed President Eric Rosengren called on Congress to expand the Fed's powers to\nbuy and sell a broader range of assets. This will require congressional\napproval, and during this period of crisis, I'm certain Shock Doctrine politics\nwill win out, and these ammendments will pass. I hope I'm wrong.</p>\n<p>So what does this mean? This means that the Fed can start buying non-government\nbacked securities: potentially any failing public stocks, private CDOs and\nMBSs<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-4\" id=\"user-content-fnref-4\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup>. What this means is\nthe Fed can buy the most dangerous, volatile, and toxic assets that nobody else\nis buying, the ones that are the first to fail in a bursting bubble. This is a\nFed that has institutionalized &#x26; <em>encouraged</em> systemic moral hazard—\nsaying, in effect: <q>If you (the finance sector) create risky assets and they\nfail, we'll allow you to profit during the good times and we'll save you by\nbuying them back during the bad times</q>.</p>\n<p>Remember the Microsoft Zune mp3 player? Probably not, because it failed\nhorribly. Now imagine Microsoft had put so much investment into its Zune, that\nwhen nobody bought it, and the product failed, the company would've gone\nbankrupt. Now, if this were the financial sector, this is where the Fed becomes\nthe Dealer of Last Resort, steps in and buys all the Zune mp3 players, saving\nMicrosoft from going bankrupt.</p>\n<p>This is exactly what the Fed is doing when it says it is \"expanding its balance\nsheet\"—its buying the failed assets the financial industry has created over the\nlast 10 years, those very same assets the industry has made huge profits from;\nbut now that the profits have stopped, the Fed bails them out by buying them\nwhen no one else will.</p>\n<p>(Update: Jan 2021<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-5\" id=\"user-content-fnref-5\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">2</a></sup>, Nov 2021<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-6\" id=\"user-content-fnref-6\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">3</a></sup>) nearly 10 months since this essay was published, we're\nalready seeing strong indicators that consumer purchasing power\nwill be severely hurt by inflation. So while government stipends may help in the\nnear short term, long term people will be hurt by less value for every dollar\nthey earn.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/images/2020-03-15-M2-money-stock.png\" alt=\"FRED: M2 Money Stock\">\n  <figcaption>\n    Chart from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. FRED M2 Money Stock.\n    <br>\n    The US Fed has printed more money in 2020 alone than the prior 6 years \n    combined.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>When the Fed goes to congress to ask for changes to Section 14, they will use\nthe Shock Doctrine playbook: <q>the banks will fail</q>, <q>retirement funds\nwill tank</q>, <q>companies will go out of business</q>, <q>we're in desperate\ntimes, so we need to take desparate measures</q>. These predictions are all\ntrue, and these outcomes will happen: but the solution they offer only addresses\nthe symptoms, but not the root cause— the\n<strong>deregulation<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-1\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">4</a></sup></strong> of the\nfinancial sector. Neoliberal deregulation of the financial sector over the last\n40 years has encouraged banks to put money into risky bubbles that keep popping,\nretirement funds of regular people are directly tied into that system, even\n<em>fueling it</em>. This is wrong. I'm not generally opposed to these risky\ninvestments, but these investments <em>must</em> be separated from investment banks,\nand kept out of any fund designed for peoples retirements and long term savings.\nThese asset types need to be drastically limited to qualified investors and\nspeculators only.</p>\n<p>As it stands, bailouts will reward the most risky investors and speculators,\nwhile passive investors, retirees, and taxpayers will end up bailing out these\nrisk takers. Thus, for the finance sector, the Fed provides <strong>elasticity</strong>:\nfungible rules around banking, investing, taxation, and bailouts when things go\nbad. For the rest of the economy, and individuals, we get <strong>discipline</strong>:\nmassive losses, austerity and cuts to social programs and public infrastructure,\nmoralizing our individual failures as people, capitalizing on the large-scale\nfailures of small businesses<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-3\" id=\"user-content-fnref-3\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">5</a></sup>, and continual indebtedness for the poor and\nmiddle classes.</p>\n<p>This is an ideological conservatism combined with a blind faith in an economics\nthat can never be wrong. As Frank Wilhoit put it <q>Conservatism consists of\nexactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects\nbut does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not\nprotect</q> (See\n<cite><a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288\">The travesty of liberalism</a></cite>\nby <a href=\"https://www.broadheath.com/\">Frank Wilhoit</a> 2018). Only the in-group is an\nautonomous, rogue financial sector, and the politial interest groups they fund.\nThe out-group is everyone else.</p>\n<p>In this way the finance industry can reap the profits of risky financial\ninstruments, but when the risk generates market failures, the Fed bails them\nout. It's all upside, and no downside. This is the very definition of moral\nhazard. The financial industry literally cannot lose because the Fed will always\nsave them.</p>\n<p>In effect, this is <q>Socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the\npoor</q> —\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&#x26;id=B8k6btUYR68C&#x26;q=%22socialism+for+the+rich%22#v=snippet&#x26;q=%22socialism%20for%20the%20rich%22&#x26;f=false\">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>\n(pp 346).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_socialism\">Lemon socialism</a> is a\npejorative term for a form of government intervention in which government\nsubsidies go to weak or failing firms (lemons; see Lemon law), with the\neffective result that the government (and thus the taxpayer) absorbs part or\nall of the recipient's losses. The term derives from the conception that in\nsocialism the government may nationalize a company's profits while leaving the\ncompany to pay its own losses, while in lemon socialism the company is allowed\nto keep its profits but its losses are shifted to the taxpayer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the imbalance: Why does the Fed continually save the financial industry every\n10 years, but not any other industry? Why does the\n<a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_200312a\">Fed create and spend 1.5T dollars to purchase worthless and arcane financial instruments</a>,\nbut never spend on public goods like housing, student education, public\ninfrastructure<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-2\" id=\"user-content-fnref-2\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">6</a></sup>?</p>\n<p>And now we get to the systemic asymetries of power. Trump and those within his\ninner circle, as well as his political base believe they are entitled to the\nrights and protections of the law, and meanwhile cast blame and stigmatize those\nleast able to defend themselves. Their in-group will be the first to receive the\nbenefit of any bailouts, and the negative consequences will be blamed upon, and\nmost adversely affect the out-group. As\n<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/\">Adam Serwer</a>\nputs it: <q>the cruelty is the point</q>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only the president and his allies, his supporters, and their anointed are entitled\nto the rights and protections of the law, and if necessary, immunity from it.\nThe rest of us are entitled only to cruelty, by their whim. This is how the\npowerful have ever kept the powerless divided and in their place, and enriched\nthemselves in the process.</p>\n<figcaption>\n  &mdash;\n  Adam Serwer,\n  <cite>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/\" rel=\"external\" title=\"The Cruelty is the Point\">The\n      Cruelty is the Point\n    </a>\n  </cite>\n</figcaption>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We, as a society are starting to understand that the financial sector is rotten\nto the core, and this rot is going to seep into public sentiment: <em>\"If they\ndon't play by the rules, why should I?\"</em>.
