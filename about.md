🎒🌎👁🔑Backpacker, Web developer & open web enthusiast, privacy and encryption
advocate. Recovering techno-utopian. Idealist. 

## Introduction

In '04 I was employed by a series of technology concerns doing business as a
software engineer, as a specialist in the production of web and mobile applications.
I begin experimenting with Bitcoin toward the end of 2012, where I divided my
time between taming web applications and analyzing Bitcoin. I attended M.65 Blockchain
Technology class at the MIT Media Lab in the autumn of 2015. About a year later
I agreed to give all of my time to FinTech; and shortly afterwards I left Nara
Logics, and moved over to Cinch Financial in Boston. I have been there ever since.

I was married in July, 2014, to my wife, whom I had met while living in
Somerville, in 2010.

Occasionally I get away from Boston for a few days, to attend the meeting of some
Meetup society or for a trip to the mountains. Regularly during the spring and
summer and fall I get “up river” or into the woods on weekends and holidays to
make up for the hours which I have to waste in the office and workshop.

I never have had time nor strength to take any part in public life, but I have
managed to do a good deal of open source development work in connection with
technical problems on the web and with the occasional rabble-rousing with various
social justice groups. Once in a while I publish an article on my blog or on
Medium.com. I belong to twitter, as well as to others online, and I am also a
member of the Ember.js Meetup Group of Boston. Social clubs do not appeal to me.

I always leave home with [whatever book
I'm reading at the moment](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60524683-0xadada?shelf=currently-reading)
paired with a Moleskine notebook for note-taking and writing rough drafts. At
work and home, I have a customized 
[Kenisis Ergo Advantage keyboard](https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/)
with Cherry MX brown switches and keytravel
reducer o-rings.<br>
* *What Software?*<br>
macOS Sierra, Android and Chrome OS. iTerm2 and RXVT terminals get a ton of
use. Firefox is my primary browser and Chome for development. I use
[neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) for development and writing.
[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) for email.
[Signal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)
 for text messaging along with Twitter. I use Git quite a lot.
[Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) and
[Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/) for file transfers.
For getting shit done, my
[homebrew manifest](https://github.com/0xadada/dotfiles/blob/master/brew.sh#L27)
will tell you the regular tools I use.
Otherwise, Fuck Facebook, Fuck Dropbox. On Android i like 
[Todoist](https://todoist.com/) for ToDos,
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/) for logging miles,
[Betterment](https://www.betterment.com) for saving/investing,
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) for reading, and
[Pocket](https://getpocket.com) has a great text-to-speech mode that makes it easy
to listen to my reads while working out or running. I listen to podcasts with
[Player.fm](https://player.fm).
* *When did you start web development?*<br>
In high school back in 1996, shortly after I got on the internet. I made a fake
"web consulting" agency website, and companies started hiring me to build
their websites.
* *What would be your dream setup?*<br>
A VR system like the Oculus or Google Daydream (with higher resolution) and
complete support for the desktop environment inside VR. If someone would implement
vim in the VR space, that would be killer. The idea is to have a complete
development environment with just a smartphone, keyboard and VR headset. This
would eliminate the need for the desktop monitor and I could use my desk for books
and writing on paper. Oh, and a fireplace, I love fireplaces.
