## FAQ

* *Where do you live?*<br>
Greater Boston Area, Massachusetts USA.
* *What do you do for work?*<br>
I build web and mobile apps on the internet.
* *What hardware do you use?*<br>
Apple Macbookpro. At home I'm still productive on battle-hardened `Early-2011` 8,2
(w/ SSD & ram upgrades). I sometimes travel with a Samsung Chromebook 3, and find
it more useful every day.
I ride a custom built track bike all year. I carry a Google Pixel 5". I've been a long
fan of Google Android hardware having used the HTC Dream/G1, Nexus S and Nexus 5. 
I always leave home with [whatever book
I'm reading at the moment](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60524683-0xadada?shelf=currently-reading)
paired with a Moleskine notebook for note-taking and writing essays. At
work and home, I have a customized 
[Kenisis Ergo Advantage keyboard](https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/)
with Cherry MX brown switches and keytravel
reducer o-rings.<br>
* *What Software?*<br>
macOS, Android and Chrome OS. iTerm2 and RXVT terminals get a ton of
use. Firefox is my primary browser and Chrome for development. I use
[neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) for development and writing.
[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) for email.
[Signal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)
 for text messaging along with Twitter. I use Git and GitHub quite a lot.
[Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) and
[Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/) for file transfers.
For getting shit done, my
[homebrew manifest](https://github.com/0xadada/dotfiles/blob/master/brew.sh#L27)
will tell you the regular tools I use. On Android i like 
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/) for tracking my runs,
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) for reading, and
[Pocket](https://getpocket.com) has a great text-to-speech mode that makes it easy
to listen to articles and white papers working out or running. I listen to podcasts with
[Player.fm](https://player.fm).
* *When did you start web development?*<br>
In 1996, shortly after I got on the internet. I started a mock
web consulting agency, and companies started actually hiring me to build
their websites.
* *What would be your dream setup?*<br>
A cabin in the mountains and a Mid-2015 Macbook Pro 11,5, 15.4"/2.8 Quad-core
i7/16GB/1TB-Flash. This was the best laptop ever made by Apple, last good one 
before the shitty touchbar generation. Otherwise
a good 27" retina display, and a keyboard. Ample space for books and a library
nearby.
