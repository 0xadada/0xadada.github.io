Backpacker, Web developer & open web enthusiast, privacy and encryption
advocate. Recovering techno-utopian. Idealist.

0xADADA is a software developer working for AI and web related startups in
Boston; graduated from Northeastern University with degrees in Computer Science
and Cognitive Psychology. 

## Introduction

In '04 I was employed by a series of technology concerns doing business as a
software engineer, as a specialist in the production of web and mobile applications.
I begin experimenting with Bitcoin toward the end of 2012, where I divided my
time between taming web applications and analyzing Bitcoin. I attended M.65 Blockchain
Technology class at the MIT Media Lab in the autumn of 2015. Shortly afterwards I left Nara
Logics, and moved over to fintech. I have been there ever since.

Occasionally I get away from Boston for a few days, to attend the meeting of some
Meetup society or for a trip to the mountains. Regularly during the spring and
summer and fall I get “up river” or into the woods on weekends and holidays to
make up for the hours which I have to waste in the office.

I never have had time nor strength to take any part in "public" life, but I have
managed to do a good deal of open source development work in connection with
technical problems on the web and with the occasional rabble-rousing with various
social justice groups. Once in a while I publish an essay on my site. I belong
to twitter, as well as to other online communities., and I am also a
member of the Ember.js Meetup Community of Boston. Otherwise social media does not
appeal to me.

## FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

Greater Boston Area, Massachusetts USA.
* *What do you do for work?*<br>
I'm a software engineer building web and mobile apps for startups
in Boston. I enjoy building things for the internet.
* *What hardware do you use?*<br>
Apple Macbookpro. At home I'm still productive on battle-hardened `Early-2011` 8,2

it more useful every day.

fan of Google Android hardware having used the HTC Dream/G1, Nexus S and Nexus 5. 
I always leave home with [whatever book

paired with a Moleskine notebook for note-taking and writing rough drafts. At
work and home, I have a customized 
[Kenisis Ergo Advantage keyboard](https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/)
with Cherry MX brown switches and keytravel
reducer o-rings.<br>
* *What Software?*<br>
macOS Sierra, Android and Chrome OS. iTerm2 and RXVT terminals get a ton of
use. Firefox is my primary browser and Chome for development. I use
[neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) for development and writing.
[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) for email.
[Signal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)

For getting shit done, my
[homebrew manifest](https://github.com/0xadada/dotfiles/blob/master/brew.sh#L27)
will tell you the regular tools I use. On Android i like 
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/) for tracking my runs,
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) for reading, and
[Pocket](https://getpocket.com) has a great text-to-speech mode that makes it easy

In 1996, shortly after I got on the internet. I started a fake

their websites.
* *What would be your dream setup?*<br>
A cabin in the mountains and a Mid-2015 Macbook Pro 11,5, 15.4"/2.8 Quad-core
i7/16GB/1TB-Flash. This was the best laptop ever made by Apple, last good one 
before the shitty touchbar generation. Otherwise
a good 27" retina display, and a keyboard. Ample desk space for books and a library
nearby.
