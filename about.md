## FAQ

- _Alignment?_<br> Chaotic Neutral
- _Where do you live?_<br> Greater Boston Area, Massachusetts USA.
- _What do you do for work?_<br> I build web and mobile apps on the internet.
- _What hardware do you use?_<br> Apple Macbookpro. At home I'm still productive
  on battle-hardened `Early-2011` 8,2 (w/ SSD & ram upgrades). I sometimes
  travel with a Samsung Chromebook 3, and find it more useful every day. I ride
  a custom built track bike all year. I carry a Google Pixel 5". I've been a
  long fan of Google Android hardware having used the HTC Dream/G1, Nexus S and
  Nexus 5. I always leave home with
  [whatever book I'm reading at the moment](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60524683-0xadada?shelf=currently-reading)
  paired with a Moleskine notebook for note-taking and writing essays. At work
  and home, I have a customized
  [Kenisis Ergo Advantage keyboard](https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/)
  with Cherry MX brown switches and keytravel reducer o-rings.<br>
- _What Software?_<br> macOS, Android and Chrome OS. iTerm2 and RXVT terminals
  get a ton of use. Firefox is my primary browser and Chrome for development. I
  use [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) for development and writing.
  [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) for email.
  [Signal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)
  for text messaging along with Twitter. I use Git and GitHub quite a lot.
  [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) and
  [Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/) for file transfers. For getting shit
  done, my
  [homebrew manifest](https://github.com/0xadada/dotfiles/blob/master/brew.sh#L27)
  will tell you the regular tools I use. On Android i like
  [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) for tracking my runs,
  [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) for reading, and
  [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) has a great text-to-speech mode that makes it
  easy to listen to articles and white papers working out or running. I listen
  to podcasts with [Player.fm](https://player.fm).
- _When did you start web development?_<br> In 1996, shortly after I got on the
  internet. I started a mock web consulting agency, and companies started
  actually hiring me to build their websites.
- _What would be your dream setup?_<br> A cabin in the mountains and a Mid-2015
  Macbook Pro 11,5, 15.4"/2.8 Quad-core i7/16GB/1TB-Flash. This was the best
  laptop ever made by Apple, last good one before the shitty touchbar
  generation. Otherwise a good 27" retina display, and a keyboard. Ample space
  for books and a library nearby.
