## FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

* *Where do you live?*<br>
I live around Cambridge/Somerville/Boston, Massachusetts USA.
* *What do you do for work?*<br>
I'm a software engineer building web and mobile apps for a startups
in Boston. I enjoy building things for the internet.
* *What hardware do you use?*<br>
I ride a 2006 Fuji Track fixed gear bike daily. Both to get me places and to maintain my
hipster status. I carry a Google Pixel, after using the G1, Nexus S and Nexus 5. 
I always leave home with [whatever book
I'm reading at the moment](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60524683-0xadada?shelf=currently-reading)
paired with a Moleskine notebook for note-taking and writing rough drafts. At
work and home, I have a customized 
[Kenisis Ergo Advantage keyboard](https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/)
with Cherry MX brown switches and keytravel
reducer o-rings.<br>
I use a variation of an Apple MacBook Pro everywhere. At work I use a Mid-2015
(The last of the Great MBP hardware). At home I'm still productive on battle-hardened
Early-2011 8,2 (with many upgrades). A Mid-2010 13" for a travel laptop. I'm against
using wearables and home automation hardware for privacy reasons.
* *What Software?*<br>
I use macOS Sierra at work and Arch Linux at home on the MBPs. iTerm2 and RXVT
terminals get a ton of use. Firefox is my primary browser and Chome for
development. I use vim for all development and writing.
[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/)
for email. [Signal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms)
 for text messaging along with Twitter. I use GPG and Git
quite a bit. [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) and
[Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/)
for file transfers. For getting shit done, my
[homebrew manifest](https://github.com/0xadada/dotfiles/blob/master/brew.sh#L27)
will tell you the regular tools I use.
Otherwise, Fuck Facebook, Fuck Dropbox, fuck Google. I use Android on the Phone with
[Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) for ToDos,
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/),
[Betterment](https://www.betterment.com) for saving/investing,
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com),
[Pocket](https://getpocket.com),
and [Podcast Addict](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambuna.podcastaddict)
for podcasts.
* *When did you start web development?*<br>
In high school back in 1996, shortly after I got on the internet. I made a fake
"web consulting" company website, and companies started hiring me to build
their websites.
* *What would be your dream setup?*<br>
A VR system like the Oculus or Google Daydream (with higher resolution) and
complete support for the desktop environment inside VR. If someone would implement
vim in the VR space, that would be killer. The idea is to have a complete
development environment with just a smartphone, keyboard and VR headset. This
would eliminate the need for the desktop monitor and I could use my desk for books
and writing on paper. Oh, and a fireplace, I love fireplaces.
