![RASpec Impreza 2.0](/static/images/2015-08-15-raspec-impreza-exterior-front-left-01-far.jpg)

The RASpec Impreza is a 2002 Subaru WRX "bugeye" chassis purchased in 2011 and fully
restored from 2013 to 2015. The car was built by DENT Sport Garage and
[German Performance Service](http://www.germanperformanceservice.com/) in
Massachusetts.

I built the RASpec Impreza as a cross-campaign race car
capable of competing in time attack, time trial, hillclimb and wheel-to-wheel
racing series up and down the East Coast.

This car was originally purchased in 2004, and gradually transformed from street
car into full race car. The build was done iteratively informed from performance
metrics at races.

## Chassis

</gallery>
 
The chassis is a 2002 model year, GDA/B code.

The restoration began with a complete tear-down. Everything not welded to the
chassis was removed, tagged and inspected. Anything not required for racing such
as the interior and OEM suspension was sold. Anything worn was cataloged, and
new factory OEM replacements were ordered (such as chassis gommets and rubber
window seals). The paint and rubberized under-body weatherproofing was removed
by media-blasting and sanding. Next the chassis was fully seam-welded. Finally
the roll cage was built and the car was freshly painted white.

- WEIGHT: 2762 lbs
- CAGE: SCCA multi-point rollcage
- CHASSIS: The entire chassis has been seam-welded

## Engine

- ![Engine intercooler](/static/images/2015-08-15-raspec-impreza-engine-intercooler.jpg)
</gallery>

The RASpec Impreza engine is a JDM EJ207 WRX STI 2-liter engine running the
[Tomei 2.2l stroker kit](http://www.tomeiusa.com/_2003web-catalogue/efr_set-from_top-menu/efr_index-com-genesis.html).
The Tomei 2.2l stroker kit was chosen as it is complete with pistons, rods and
the lightened, custom journaled crankshaft. The heads are sourced from a JDM
Spec-C WRX STI that come from the factory with larger ports, and factory
polished.

The engine was built to tolerances provided by the team running the
[Cusco / Tomei / Voltex Time Attack Impreza](http://www.superstreetonline.com/features/turp-0902-tomei-cusco-voltex-subaru-impreza-wrx-sti/)
as they use the same engine stroker kit.

The intake side has a custom fabricated front mounted intercooler (design is
inspired by the Subaru Impreza WRC S10 design) pressurized by a Garrett GT3076R
turbo using a TiAL GT30 turbine housing to feed the reverse mounted JDM STI
intake manifold (no TGVs).

The turbo wastegate is a TiAL MR-R 44mm. The turbo uses the TiAL V-Band Clamp
and Flange System to allow full 306 degree rotation for optimal turbo
positioning.

## History

![The "RASpec Impreza 1.0" racing at Summit Point in the Redline Time Attack series, 2010.](/static/images/2015-08-15-raspec-impreza-racing.jpg)

I raced the RASpec 1.0 at [COM Time Trial](http://www.comscc.org/) events, the
[Redline Time Attack](http://www.redlinetimeattack.com/) series, the
[BMW Sports Car Club](https://www.bmwcca.org/) track events, and
[New England Hillclimb](http://www.hillclimb.org/) series.

A crash at a New England Hillclimb Race Series in 2010 ended the useable life of
the "RASpec Impreza 1.0", and I began searching for a "bugeye" Impreza to use as
a new chassis for the "2.0" version of the RASpec Impreza.

In 2011 I found a "bugeye" WRX that would serve as the perfect base for a new
race car. The bugeye was parted-out and stripped, and the build of my second
race car began. It was only fitting that it be called the "RASpec Impreza 2.0".

The key features of the 2.0 version that were improvements over the 1.0 version
were as follows:

- Fully stripped, media-blasted, caged and seam-welded chassis in order to
  reduce weight and increase rigidity
- Simplify turbo and intercooler setup to reduce maintenance and increase air
  flow

The resulting product of the build is a car that is lighter, faster and easier
to maintain than the first race car. The "RASpec Impreza 2.0" is a better
overall car, it takes the best aspects of the 1.0 and simplifies until there is
nothing else to take away&mdash; creating a minimalist race-ready track
platform.

## FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

- _What makes the car track-only?_<br/> Its a fully-built race car, so its been
  stripped to the bare essentials. This means no headlights, no wiper bottle, no
  seatbelts (harness only), no OEM seat brackets, no ODB-II.
- _What does it need to go racing?_<br/> I would get new tires, bleed the brakes
  and adjust the alignment. Alignment should be set to your preferences for how
  you like the car to turn-in and rotate. You may want to adjust the ride-height
  as well.
- _How many track miles on it?_<br/> None. The chassis has 0 track miles on it,
  and the engine has been freshly rebuilt. The only "time" its seen is on the
  dyno while it was being tuned.
- _Horsepower?_<br/> Currently it's running a conservative base map dialed for 350 wheel horse
  power at 20lbs of boost. This tune was done at
  [Synaptic3 Performance](http://www.synaptic3.com/) for a practice day where we
  were focusing on suspension setup and were not racing. The previous tune made
  400whp at 23lbs of boost. On dyno testing its made much more at higher boost,
  but we've dialed it back to increase engine longevity. Using the same engine
  parts, tolerances and turbo, Cusco / Tomei / Voltex made 500whp.

## 2019 Update

This car is now owned and campaigned at Global Time Attack and other events by
[Bad Panda Motorsports](https://badpandamotorsports.com/).
