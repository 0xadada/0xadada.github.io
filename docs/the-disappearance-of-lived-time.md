We stand on the brink of a precipice.
In front of us lies a society driven for the sake of productivity, the mechanics increasingly directed by artificial intelligence to serve corporate interests.
Behind us lies centuries of experiments in social organization that provide the historical and material foundation of society.
Some failed with communism's collapse in 1991, while the capitalist experiment shifted to the authoritarian 'capitalism with Chinese characteristics' in the east, or the more subtly coercive neoliberal experiment in the west.
This experiment has raised many out of poverty, and yet has not improved the quality of _life_.
As
<abbr title='"We stand on the brink... we peer into the abyss..." (Poe, 2022).'>we peer into the abyss</abbr>,[^poe]
we grow sick with emergent
<span className="note"><small>Social diseases: We are **not** saying that these diseases are naturally occurring facts, nor are we saying that these diseases do not exist, but we recognize that they are really experienced diseases that are contingent upon existing conditions of neoliberal capitalism.</small>social diseases</span>--anxiety,
depression, exhaustion, and burnout.
These conditions are a symptom of a way of life that lacks direction.
With the gradual shift to secular life, we've turned away from communal practices that provide spaces and times that lead to human flourishing.
These practices included holidays in which contemplation, prayer, and meditative practices were observed--e.g. Shabbat and Sundays.
These were times allocated to prayer, creative play, leisure, reflection, rest, and quiet solitude that are no longer protected or made available to greater society.
We have abandoned the practice of community-rest, pushing it into the private domain of the individual, but what we have lost is leisure and the communities that exist within leisure.
The position of this essay is not a call to return to some golden past, or a renewed spiritual order, but an acknowledgment of the conditions that lead to what we have lost.
It explores a revitalization of times and spaces for human flourishing that were formerly protected by a spiritual order, but can equally be rooted in secular thought.
I propose points of resistance to a dominant social order that seeks to continually capture the vestiges of free time.

At this juncture, we, collectively, can _consciously_ decide what the future will hold for humanity--we can determine what that looks like, what we’re building, and to what ends.
If we do not rise to this challenge, then the instrumental power that has emerged out of neoliberal capitalism will decide our future for its own, ultimately banal, ends.
Together we can decide if we want increases in productivity to appear in the form of profits for the few, or as surplus time allocated to the many--the latter of which can be used for leisure and the concrete activity of creating a brighter future for all.

but its own self-evident truth--one that is deeply felt.

## The Historicity of Time

'Time' is natural, physical, and spatial; it exists independently of humanity.
'History', however, is humanities
"<span className="note"><small>Bunyard 2018, p. 216.</small>awareness of its existence within a temporal reality—only arises with the emergence of human beings</span>",[^bunyard1]
and is shaped by humanity.
The great arcs of history are determined by the rulers of their period, and individuals are capable (to a certain extent) of generating their own personal narratives within that period.
<span className="note"><small>Bunyard 2018, p. 4.</small>History, therefore, is a process directed by human agents to shape their world, and create their own identities through that activity</span>.[^bunyard1]

In order to establish an understanding of our contemporary perception of time, we will begin with
<span className="note"><small>This periodization draws heavily on the philosophical anthropology of Guy Debord from his 1967 book _The Society of the Spectacle_ (Debord 2021).</small>a periodization that describes the perception of time across history</span>.
Along the arc of history, different social structures emerged that engender differing temporalities, thus a society's perception of history and its place in time is socially mediated.[^bunyard1]
The following table lists distinct temporal periods called 'ages'.
Each age is mediated by a form of social organization that generates specific perceptions of time called 'temporalities'.

| _Age_                           | _Social organization_ | _Temporality_                                               | _Related periods_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Each age describes the dominant forces that structure daily life and determine perceptions of time--the
<span className="note"><small>A zeitgeber is an external cue that entrains or synchronizes an organism's biological rhythms. These are natural factors like light, temperature, seasons, but can include social cues like work schedules or gig apps.</small>zeitgeber</span>.
There is overlap between ages, both temporally and spatially.
An age is more keenly experienced in the city than in the countryside.
The procession of one age to the next doesn't entail that the previous age has ended, but that its' forces have receded to the background--they become infrastructural rather than hegemonic.
To illustrate, the mythic narratives that arose from the Age of Gods & Men remain with us in the form of stories and metaphors that provide us with rich cultural allegory.
In another case, the Age of Kings had no definitive end, in fact, relics like the Queen of England still exist, but monarchy has receded to the background, and thus have become merely cultural.
Institutions like religion, which previously dominated social organization have similarly receded to the background.
In some sectors secular life has completely subsumed spiritual life, and spiritual life is relegated to the private domain of the individual.
The ages of the past are still with us, but they've become a given, received culture, one that is taken for granted--it's issues and contentions are settled debate, but still have relevance.
Past ages become social and cultural foundations--but just like a buildings' foundation, they are more ossified and unchanging.
The hegemonic age, however, dominates in its effects on daily life, it organizes social institutions, it's open to continual evolution and debate, and is always changing and dynamic.

![Chart of time and history](/static/images/2024-05-01-time-and-history.png)

We will now describe each of the five ages: the Age of Gods & Men, the Age of Cyclical Nature, the Age of Kings, the Age of Economic Production, and the Age of the Autonomous Spectacle.

The **Age of Gods & Men** is the period before prehistory.
It is accessible only through the archeological record and surviving oral traditions.
This is a period in which nature recurs with time, the coming and going of the seasons and celestial bodies.
This is a **Mythic society** prior to the mastery of language.
Mythic society was a directly lived experience, created by their own direct actions, one in which all individuals directly participated--_by necessity_.
The hegemonic temporality associated with this age was **Cyclical time**.
Cyclical time shaped their understanding of time as they confronted naturally cyclical conditions, repeated along every moment of their nomadic journey with the seasons and according to the migratory patterns of wild game and local flora.
The spatial modality of this period is characterized by territories that were undifferentiated and therefore uniform—that is to say, hunter-gatherers didn't stay in a single territory long enough to shape their environment.
This age applied to human societies until the invention of agriculture, animal husbandry, and the emergence of subsistence farming.

The **Age of Cyclical Nature** is characterized as a time that is proto-historical.
When agriculture began, communities invested labor into the land, imbuing it with content.
This attached the community to the land, and therefore enclosed the community within cultivated property--one surrounded by a differentiated region of uncultivated lands.
This was a shift from the nomadic seasonal cycle, returning people to undifferentiated but similar places, giving way to the agrarian perception of the return of a set of gestures in time (planting, harvesting, etc) attached to a single place.
Agrarian society, therefore generated the spatial modality of "differentiated property" and "undifferentiated lands".
The transition from the pastoral nomadism of the Age of Gods & Men to settled agriculture marked the end of an idle and unattached freedom, and the beginning of labor.
The Agrarian society and agricultural mode of production is governed by the rhythm of the seasons, and as such is the implementation of **Cyclical time** in its fullest development.

The **Age of Kings** emerged from the practice of permanent agricultural settlements, and the growth of cities.[^braudel2]
The Age of Kings is characterized by the division of social classes, each specializing in a different aspect of the total production of society: farmers, warriors, priests, and the nobility.
The nobility organized social labor on the basis of the accumulation of wealth in the form of <span className="note"><small>Surplus value during the Age of Kings was the total amount of crop remaining after farmers fed themselves and paid taxes.</small>surplus value</span>.
This class also appropriated the _temporal surplus value_ that resulted from the exploitation of the farming class.
Surplus time was invested into the development of a new form of power: the control of spatial territory and the development of history that was at the sole discretion of the nobility.
The development of history is a new form of power controlled by the nobility over the direction, management, and recording of historical time.
This is a power inaccessible to the laboring and agrarian classes.
This power is most visible in the historical chronicle—a story narrating the events deemed most significant to the ruling class, and often the only recorded history until the invention of the printing press.
The nobility used this instrument to establish the forward progression of their historical time by recording its past with writing.
The historical chronicle of the nobility develops and collapses fully autonomously and as a separate sphere of abstracted reality from natural reality, this is **Mythical time**.
China and Egypt both held a monopoly on the immortality of the soul, and the earliest of their famous dynasties are built upon imaginary reconstructions of the past.
The rulers of these empires, as the owners of the private property of history--protected by a mythical past, make use of myth to prove the legitimacy of their claim to rule.
The intention is to be understood as the earthly execution of <span className="note"><small>Mythic commandments would later be repurposed by religion to continue underwriting the control of power in the spiritual domain, best exemplified by the Holy Roman Empire.</small>mythic commandments</span>.
The more they claimed historical ownership over time and tied it to their own mythical chronicles, the more they legitimated their control over power.

The development of mythical history began with the administration of kingdoms that went hand-in-hand with the invention of writing.
Mythical history gives time an orientation, a direction, and imbues it with meaning and significance.
The emergence of history necessitated a development beyond Mythical time to the temporality of **Irreversible time**.
The linear trajectory of irreversible time presupposes the prospect of endless economic development linked to the production of surplus value, the
<span className="note"><small>Lowercase c-capital in this instance can take the form of money, labor, and time.</small>control of this value in the form of capital</span>,
and the political management of the power that results.
Irreversible time is oriented around the succession of the nobility, and its measure of progress is determined by the number of successful successions.
The Age of Kings was a profoundly **Historical society** in that social organization was underwritten by history.
It was during this age that history had increasing proximity to everyday existence but the possibility of individual participation grew more elusive.
Individuals living in this Historical society experienced lived moments as mediated through the nobility or God as facilitator, since the nobility had sole possession of
<span className="note"><small>The conception of duty has been a means used by the holders of power to induce others to live for the interest of their masters, rather than for their own</small>how individuals time was used and allocated--so called 'duty'</span>.[^russell]
The nobility were the only ones to be in a position to have knowledge of, and experience the enjoyment of directly lived events, while those in the city spectate upon what is essentially a conflict over power--witnesses to a story that is not their own; which is to say, they were mere spectators, alienated from directing the most important events that define their lives, and destined to be forgotten.
In order for the irreversible time of history to cohere in the collective memory of individuals, there needed to be participation in these officially recorded events (as it was their duty).
The wealth accumulated by the nobility was expended on lavish feasts and festivals--best exemplified by the
<span className="note"><small>The term Bread & Circuses comes from Juvenal, a Roman poet active in the Second Century AD. The phrase is a critique of the political class who deliver not public services or policy, but instead public diversions, distractions, or other means of appeasing the populace with trivial or base appeals to amusement or other simple pleasures that make no lasting change or improvements to society.</small>Bread & Circuses of the Roman Empire</span>[^graeber2]
that created fleeting moments of participatory lived experience mediated by the nobility.
<span className="note"><small>The major events of this period culminated in the Crusades.</small>The resulting participation in these events</span>
is a recognition amongst individuals as the possessors of a unique present, a period defined by the richness of their own actions, and a home built by their own (mediated) experience.
For members of the Historical society, Irreversible time truly exists, and within it they create memories of their own history as well as the emergence of a newfound fear of _being forgotten_ into the oblivion of Cyclical time.
The spatial modality of this age was _the control of territory_, and the weapon of choice was, for the first time, the written word.
Ironically, the power of the nobility was legitimated by claims (familial or fictional) to a mythical past.
It was during this age that
<span className="note"><small>e.g. Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism.</small>monotheistic religions</span>
developed and made a compromise between myth and history--one that bridged the gap between Cyclical time (as it dominated the sphere of agricultural production), and the Irreversible time that was the theater of politics.
The religions that developed out of monotheism were the fundamental building blocks universally acknowledged as useful for building new Historical societies based on Irreversible time.
It was during this age where one's life was measured according to Irreversible time, in the form of successive stages of life (childhood, adulthood, old-age), with the consideration of life as a _voyage_, as passage without return, in a world whose meaning culminates in the spatial elsewhere of
<span className="note"><small>According to the Augustinian Proclamation, the Catholic Church in Vatican City was the unitary physical space shared with Heaven (Augustine 1993).</small>Heaven</span>.[^augustine2]
Individuals found the fulfillment of their personal histories within the sphere of the ruling nobility.
So, just as the nobility defined themselves by waging war over disputed power, individuals attached their personal historical chronicles to their rulers--thus, the knight and his personal story is entwined with the story of duty to his king.
The Age of Kings applies to feudal civilizations in China, Egypt, Greece, Iran, Rome, Europe, Japan, and Latin America.

As long as agriculture remained the primary form of labor during the Age of Kings, cyclical time continued to constrain social life with _tradition_, which inhibited the development of Irreversible time.
It wasn't until the rise of mercantilism that the bourgeoisie emerged, challenging the monopoly on irreversible time.[^debord1][^braudel3]
It was only then that the irreversible time of the bourgeois economy was brought to bear upon the remaining vestiges of cyclical time, eradicating it at every encounter across the globe.
As the bourgeoisie gained control over irreversible time, their labor gradually became a project to transform historical conditions.[^debord1]
The bourgeoisie was the first ruling class for which labor became a valuable commodity.
With the gradual abolition of all nobility, social privileges, and titles, they recognize value only from the exploitation of labor, and have identified the control of the commoditized body of labor as their primary form of capital.
These developments culminated in the emergence of the Age of Economic Production.

The **Age of Economic Production** is characterized by working conditions that are the dominant zeitgeber of daily life.
This age emerged during the enlightenment and prefigured the industrial revolution with the inventions of the printing press and the clock tower.
Irreversible time limited participation to the nobility up until the period of the
<span className="note"><small>The bourgeois revolutions include the English Civil War (1642-1651), the American War of Independence (1775-1799), the French Revolution (1789-1799), the European revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and the unification movements in Germany and Italy.</small>bourgeois revolutions</span>.
During this age, irreversible time developed into its generalized form—the inevitable unfolding of events for themselves, crushing any individual in its path.
This was the emergence of the temporality of **Chronological time**: a progression of time marked by the unfolding events of the commodity, a time controlled by the market imperatives of the commodity.
This is a time of clocks that is measurable, ordered, countable, and structured.
The bourgeoisie, as rulers of the economy and specialists in the ownership of commodities, untethered history from the administration of the state and privileged the management of the economy.Increasing literacy and the historical power unleashed by the proliferation of the printing press democratized and diminished the hegemony of irreversible time.
Individuals participated in the production and consumption of commodities, which was formerly limited to the nobility.[^debord1]
It was during the later part of this age that capitalism developed across the globe, universalizing chronological time as a singular history that progresses the same everywhere at once.
This is a time belonging to the globalized marketplace.
The spatial modality of this age was _migration_, where migrant labor was the major factor in human movement.
People lived where they worked, migrations were predicated on moving to locations with improved working conditions.
Proximity to work, as well as citizenship and residential status determined access to employment.
In the United States, young people moved from familial support networks to cities with better jobs.
Space was a constraining factor in this age, where proximity to arts & culture limited what individuals could watch and listen to.
The city was the locality of the arts.
The conception of utopia during this age was increasingly secular and socially constructed, resulting in the development of liberal democracy and socialism.
It was during this age that the concept of leisure emerged as the temporality of **Consumable time**.
Consumable time is the colonizer of non-working time.
It is relegated to a subservient role as _a gift that presupposed labor_ rather than as equal to chronological time--it is free time that is legitimated by work.
To maintain these complementary roles, consumable time finds itself laden with false attributions of value, and these moments are segmented into a sequence of artificially distinct events, which are merely undifferentiated moments of time perceived to be
<span className="note"><small>In consumable time, the weekend is perceived as more valuable than the weekdays, and the general sentiment that Mondays are worse than Fridays. These moments of consumable time are perceived to be more valuable since the worker is able to consume this time freely.</small>more highly valuable</span>.[^debord1]
