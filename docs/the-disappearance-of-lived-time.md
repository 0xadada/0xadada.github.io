We stand on the brink of a precipice.
In front of us lies a society driven for the sake of productivity, the mechanics increasingly directed by artificial intelligence to serve corporate interests.
Behind us lies centuries of experiments in social organization that provide the historical and material foundation of society.
Some failed with communism's collapse in 1991, while the capitalist experiment shifted to the authoritarian 'capitalism with Chinese characteristics' in the east, or the more subtly coercive neoliberal experiment in the west.
This experiment has raised many out of poverty, and yet has not improved the quality of _life_.
As
<abbr title='"We stand on the brink... we peer into the abyss..." (Poe, 2022).'>we peer into the abyss</abbr>,
we grow sick with emergent
<span className="note">social diseases<small>Social diseases: We are **not** saying that these diseases are naturally occurring facts, nor are we saying that these diseases do not exist, but we recognize that they are really experienced diseases that are contingent upon existing conditions of neoliberal capitalism.</small></span>--anxiety,
depression, exhaustion, and burnout.
These conditions are a symptom of a way of life that lacks direction.
With the gradual shift to secular life, we've turned away from communal practices that provide spaces and times that lead to human flourishing.
These practices included holidays in which contemplation, prayer, and meditative practices were observed--e.g. Shabbat and Sundays.
These were times allocated to prayer, creative play, leisure, reflection, rest, and quiet solitude that are no longer protected or made available to greater society.
We have abandoned the practice of community-rest, pushing it into the private domain of the individual, but what we have lost is leisure and the communities that exist within leisure.
The position of this essay is not a call to return to some golden past, or a renewed spiritual order, but an acknowledgment of the conditions that lead to what we have lost.
It explores a revitalization of times and spaces for human flourishing that were formerly protected by a spiritual order, but can equally be rooted in secular thought.
I propose points of resistance to a dominant social order that seeks to continually capture the vestiges of free time.
