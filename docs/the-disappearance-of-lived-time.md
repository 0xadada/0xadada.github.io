The Power of 'No': Reclaiming Leisure from the Commodification of Time in an Age of Hyperactivity

We stand on the brink of a precipice.
In front of us lies a society driven for the sake of productivity, the mechanics increasingly directed by artificial intelligence to serve corporate interests.
Behind us lies centuries of experiments in social organization that provide the historical and material foundation of society.
Some failed with communism's collapse in 1991, while the capitalist experiment shifted to the authoritarian 'capitalism with Chinese characteristics' in the east, or the more subtly coercive neoliberal experiment in the west.
This experiment has raised many out of poverty, and yet has not improved the quality of _life_.
As
<abbr title='"We stand on the brink... we peer into the abyss..." (Poe, 2022).'>we peer into the abyss</abbr>,
we grow sick with emergent
<span className="note">social diseases<small>Social diseases: We are **not** saying that these diseases are naturally occurring facts, nor are we saying that these diseases do not exist, but we recognize that they are really experienced diseases that are contingent upon existing conditions of neoliberal capitalism.</small></span>--anxiety,
depression, exhaustion, and burnout.
These conditions are a symptom of a way of life that lacks direction.
With the gradual shift to secular life, we've turned away from communal practices that provide spaces and times that lead to human flourishing.
These practices included holidays in which contemplation, prayer, and meditative practices were observed--e.g. Shabbat and Sundays.
These were times allocated to prayer, creative play, leisure, reflection, rest, and quiet solitude that are no longer protected or made available to greater society.
We have abandoned the practice of community-rest, pushing it into the private domain of the individual, but what we have lost is leisure and the communities that exist within leisure.
The position of this essay is not a call to return to some golden past, or a renewed spiritual order, but an acknowledgment of the conditions that lead to what we have lost.
It explores a revitalization of times and spaces for human flourishing that were formerly protected by a spiritual order, but can equally be rooted in secular thought.
I propose points of resistance to a dominant social order that seeks to continually capture the vestiges of free time.

At this juncture, we, collectively, can _consciously_ decide what the future will hold for humanity--we can determine what that looks like, what we’re building, and to what ends.
If we do not rise to this challenge, then the instrumental power that has emerged out of neoliberal capitalism will decide our future for its own, ultimately banal, ends.
Together we can decide if we want increases in productivity to appear in the form of profits for the few, or as surplus time allocated to the many--the latter of which can be used for leisure and the concrete activity of creating a brighter future for all.

and they say that to become an expert you must have done 10,000 hours.[^gladwell]
There is something to be said, however, against the professional, the expert, the overachiever.
I will do my best to argue for the idler, the amateur, the layabout–for they are the experts of idleness.
I hope to join their ranks one day, and as such,

but its own self-evident truth--one that is deeply felt.
