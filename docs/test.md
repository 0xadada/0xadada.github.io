The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the existing literature concerning speech segmentation, categorical perception, and some other issues concerning bilinguals of English and Japanese. It will touch on some of the differences in the two languages and how they affect learning the L2. The paper will start by providing background information about some of the two languages and some of the current issues involved in speech processing. The paper will then delve into the most current research, what the issues are, how it was done, and the results they have found. It will then go on to discuss the possible future directions of this research and end with references.

### Text with footnote and sidenote

Debord’s text is concise, economical, poetic, provocative, and difficult. As
Michael Hardt & Antonio Negri describe it in their notes to _Empire_ as
<span class="note"><small>Quoting Hardt & Negri: "...Debord recognized this spectacle as the destiny of
triumphant capitalism. Despite their important differences, such authors offer
us real anticipations of the path of capitalist development." And continuting
in their notes: "[The Spectacle], which is perhaps the best articulation, in
its own delirious way, of the contemporary consciousness of the triumph of
capital."</small>delirious</span>.[^hardt]
His work contains many references to Hegel and Marx. He uses
words and phrases defined in other Situationist texts, and expects the reader to
be familiar with them. This is to be expected, as he demands much from the
reader, and had written for a small audience of “fifty or sixty people” who
were well versed in the history of the western philosophical tradition.

### 4. Segmentation in non-native languages

An <mark>important </mark> area of <ins>study</ins> <del>concerning</del> bilingual speech segmentation is how
non-native speakers segment their second language (L2).
<span className="spoiler">This is a spoiler!</span>.
If non-native speakers
<ruby><ruby>摆<rt>let it</rt></ruby><rt>bai</rt><rb><ruby>烂<rt>rot</rt></ruby></rb><rt>lan</rt></ruby>
can use any of the non-native language rhythmic, prosodic, lexico-syntatic, and
syntactic segmentation processes, then they will have a much easier time
segmenting the L2. The ability to learn a non-native segmentation process would
be beneficial to any bilingual as it would facilitate comprehension of the L2.
Research into brain plasticity for learning non-native language processes would
directly benefit the existing body of knowledge[^multiline].

In a study of brain plasticity and non-native lexical and segmentation
processes, Sanders et al. in 2002 came up with interesting methods for probing
non-native speakers to see if learning the L2 early in life or later in life
would effect the ability to learn non-native lexical and segmentation processes.
This study would research various language subsystems such as lexico-semantic,
syntactic, and prosodic information processing. Using the earlier proposed
theories that each language uses different methods of speech segmentation
(English: Stress-based, French: Syllable-based, Japanese: Mora-based) they tried
to find if non-native speakers used lexico-syntactic information processes when
segmenting a non-native language (Sanders et al., 2002). Four groups were
obtained to study this hypothesis, a group of native English speakers as a
control group (E), early English Japanese native speakers (JE), early English
Spanish native speakers (SE), late English Japanese native speakers (J), and a
group of late English Spanish native speakers (S). _“If non-native speakers fail
to use rhythmic segmentation cues other than the rhythmic cues relevant to their
L1, native speakers of Japanese (mora-timed) and Spanish (syllable-timed) would
not be expected to use stress pattern as a segmentation cue when listening to
English. Alternatively, native Japanese and native Spanish speakers might differ
in their abilities to use stress pattern as a segmentation cue in English.”_
(Sanders et al., 2002).

For this experiment they created 5 groups of 3 sentences
each. The 5 groups were _“Strong stress, initial position (SI), strong stress,
medial position (SM), weak stress, initial position (WI), weak stress, medial
position (WM), and target absent (TA).”_ (Sanders et al., 2002). Each group
contained 3 sentences each of which were a semantic, syntactic or acoustic
target sentence. The semantic words were normal English sentences, the syntactic
sentences replaced all open-class words with non-words, and the acoustic words
only retained the original prosody. Participants were asked to listen to a
target, and then were asked to press one button if that target was heard in the
beginning of the sentence, another button if it was heard in the middle, and the
third button if it was not heard. Results indicated that _“the fact that both
groups of late-learners were able to use the lexical information supports the
hypothesis that the lexico-semantic system remains relatively plastic beyond the
age of 12.”_ (Sanders et al., 2002). These results support the idea that late
learners can learn non-native language processes later in life, which is a
reassuring fact for late-bilinguals, however _“No group of non-native speakers
used syntactic information to the same extent as native speakers.”_ (Sanders et
al., 2002). These results, as well as other indicate that syntactic information
processes are not as easily learned later in life (Sanders et al., 2002). An
interesting finding was how both early and late learners of English
Japanese-natives were able to use some segmentation cues that are seemingly
effective in both English and Japanese; _“this study could either indicate that
both groups were applying a Japanese segmentation cue that happens to co-occur
with stress in English or that both groups had enough exposure to English to
learn a new segmentation cue.”_ (Sanders et al., 2002). Overall the findings of
this study show that both lexical and semantic segmentation subsystems retain
the _“ability to change to a greater degree than do syntactic subsystems”_
(Sanders et al., 2002).

## Code

Use CSS to skin your markup, but further separate your CSS from behavior. If we
use an anchor tag that acts as a form-POST event, write two classes; one to
describe the look of the button and another as its hint to javascript that'll be
used for attaching functionality.

**Markup**

```html
<a href="/action" title="Submit" class="c-button js-action-submit">Submit</a>
```

**CSS**

```css
.c-button {
  color: green;
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```

**JavaScript**

```js
$( '.js-action-submit' ).click( function( e ) {
  e.preventDefault();
  // do form submit
}
```
