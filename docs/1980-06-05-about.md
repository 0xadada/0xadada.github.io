## My book

I've written a book, a new English translation of Guy Debords' 1967 work of philosophy and critical theory,
_The Society of The Spectacle_. My edition isn’t as much a straight translation as it is an elaboration, or
‘remix’ that attempts to reveal more under the text than existed in the original
and its various translations. [Read my blog post about it](/2021/03/27/the-society-of-the-spectacle/)
