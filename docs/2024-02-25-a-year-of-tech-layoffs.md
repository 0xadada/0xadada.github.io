**Welcome back, stranger. Remember, its about their needs, not yours.**

![Levels.fyi layoffs](/static/images/2024-02-25-levelsfyi-layoffs-2022-2024.png)

The period from <abbr title="As of this writing">Q4 2022 through Q1 2024</abbr> has been a rough period for the tech industry, with many layoffs due to a combination of factors:

1. The end of the <abbr title="Zero Interest Rate Program">ZIRP</abbr> era, causing investors to demand profitability (instead of growth) from their portfolio companies.
2. Section 174 of the US tax code significantly changed in 2017 and went into effect in 2022. The changes require companies to amortize R&D expenses over a period of five years instead of allowing immediate expensing. This has immense impact on tech companies, particularly growth-oriented startups, leading to higher taxes on companies that likely had little revenue. The effect is that growth startups need to reduce R&D and shift immediately to profitability. <mark>TL;DR the tax incentives that fostered the era of growth-startups in the United States has been gutted</mark>.
3. Companies with a remote-first work culture hiring internationally, this means a broader, lower-cost search for talent, which is another way of saying: Globalization & outsourcing.
4. A market correction from over-hiring during the pandemic.
5. The speculative hype around free AI tools is fueling a reduction of employees—this will be a mistake, especially when VC funding stops subsidizing AI software and they start charging for their products. At that point, these companies will be locked in.

The unfortunate outcome of all these layoffs is the impact on these employees. Employment is a critical part of people's lives, and layoffs can leave long-lasting emotional scars. A job is a <abbr title="German for time giver">zeitgerber</abbr>, and aside from the circadian rhythm, it is the dominant structural organizer for the cadence of daily life. This is why unemployment is so destabilizing, it comes with a feeling of vertigo— the ground below has suddenly fallen away, or that nothing is what it was. You feel dazed & confused from sudden <abbr title="derealization is detachment from ones surroundings">derealization</abbr>, as if the world isn't real, as if you are in a dream or a fog. Unemployment is an anxious mental liminal space, a waiting room where control is largely in the hands of others—waiting for replies, waiting for call-backs, waiting for upcoming interview dates, waiting to hear back, wondering why. These feelings will pass, it is temporary.

The next hurdle is the mental investment in perpetual studying and the preparation for technical interviews (which are a poor predictor of performance). The labor is never good enough, never prepares you for all eventualities, and is **never complete**. Then there is the emotional labor of courting potential corporate suitors, imagining yourself in the role, asking the good questions, showing **passion** and **craftsmanship** only to hear them say: “sorry we're moving forward with another candidate”.

[You are not your job title](/2022/04/01/i-am-not-a-software-developer/). Being laid off says nothing about you or your worth, certainly nothing about your value as a person; they are simply the result of a calculation to further the interests of a company.

## My Experience with Layoffs

![The Dot-com Crash of 2001/2002](/static/images/2024-02-25-dot-com-crash.png)

For many this will be the first layoff experience of their career, and I feel for them. I've been here before, quite a few times in fact, perhaps you can benefit from my experience.

I started my career in software engineering as an intern at a tech startup during the dot-com crash of 2001. My internship promptly ended when the company closed and laid off most of its employees the week after I started. Aside from not having a job to help pay for rent, I didn’t earn those course credits that were a part of my graduation requirement. I went back to university for six months and then had an opportunity to make up that course credit at EMC² (Now Dell EMC) the following year. That internship also ended with another mass layoff—this time because of the [post-9/11 stock market downturn of 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_downturn_of_2002). For the remainder of my time at university, I focused on the course work. I let time sort out the economy while I wasn't participating in it.

You are going to get thrown off, it’s just a matter of when.](https://madned.substack.com/p/an-old-hackers-tips-on-staying-employed)

Eventually I graduated into the post-crash era, and had a few good jobs. In a turn of luck, I managed to avoid the [2007–2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis) unscathed—despite joining the volatile startup n2N Commerce in September of 2007. The vibe there was off, and executive leadership was at odds with Product leadership (FWIW, Product was right). I left n2N in December after only 3 months, landing a job with a friend at interactive agency RDVO. On January 2nd, my former boss at n2N called me—n2N had just done a massive round of layoffs and was [ceasing operations](https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/02/n2n-commerce-dumped-by-victorias-secret-found-in-deadpool/). I had walked away a week before the holiday disaster.

I worked handful of other jobs before joining Boston-local startup Cinch Financial, we used behavioral economics to nudge people towards positive personal finance decision making. The the company eschewed advertising as a business model. It was experimental and fun. We had small and agile teams with a pragmatically groomed backlog. We ran tightly iterative dev-UX release cycles with continuous deployment. We encouraged a non-burnout culture. We tried things, failed, and had psychological safety to take real risks. Cinch ceased operations in September 2018 during an acquisition attempt when it simply ran out of runway and failed to take flight. The entire team was laid off.

I joined Salsify in October of 2018, and like many tech startups of the ZIRP era, it was on a growth trajectory. It had a strong engineering-lead culture, with tons of interesting R&D, a steady march of new product features, and acquisitions, acquisitions, acquisitions. Salsify went through 3 rounds of layoffs in April 2020, November 2022, and October 2023—the last of which eliminated the entire business vertical I was in, and a ton of amazing people were let go, world-class engineers, designers, product & sales people.

2023 was a difficult year for me, a year of crisis. My mother had a stroke, we had two uncles die, our grandma went into the hospital, and our dog died suddenly (all within 9 months). After the layoff at Salsify, I dipped my toe into interviewing, if just to practice. I tried to finish Q4 2023 by reflecting on my career and did my best to rest during the holidays. That period provided some space to daydream, to enjoy idle contemplation. I reflected on my time at Salsify, I connected with friends. I repaired things, and installed a new kitchen faucet. I consolidated the families tech services to iCloud. I installed new laptop batteries. I read a few books & caught up on my backlog of tech blogs that had piled up over years. I took some online courses in web tech that I was interested in. I reorganized the bookshelves. I finished a bunch of tech and personal projects, most notably I finally refactored my neovim config to Lua. I refactored my blog, and did some writing on topics that I'd been <abbr title="Woolgathering refers to indulging in aimless thought, daydreaming, or contemplation without a specific purpose.

## My Job Search

I started the job search in earnest in early January and shifted my search to mature, publicly traded software companies. I'm convinced that startups in the US are in for a very difficult time unless you're in AI, crypto, or <abbr title="ventures that address significant real-world problems, often with long development timelines and high technical uncertainty">tough tech</abbr>.

After a few months of searching, it is easy to say that right now is the most difficult job market I’ve ever seen in the tech industry. There is a pool of world-class engineers available. I personally know more great talent unemployed now than ever in my entire career.. The department of labor numbers aren't reflecting how bad it is, because many of these workers are haven't filed for unemployment because <abbr title="a privilege, but one every worker should get">they're on severance</abbr>. The interview process is **far** more difficult both in terms of technical breadth, depth, 'soft-skills', and incidentals. Employers are expecting "batteries included" engineers who require 0-training, 0-investment, and fully-fit to their needs. Itʼs an employers market, so they expect to get the best, most committed engineers, and they're able to down-level at a discount.

For the first time in my career, I got no responses to applications, or companies ghosted me after the initial call. <abbr title="privilege of the software engineer">Neither of these had happened in any previous job search</abbr>. Once in the interview funnel, there were more rounds, and each round was more challenging. The previous times I interviewed (2016, again in 2018) it was standard practice to do 3-5 rounds for a senior role, now I've seen 7-8 rounds. What were formerly leetcode easy are now medium/hards. Finally, once you get to the end of the funnel, companies can be more picky since they've got multiple great candidates to choose from. At that point it often comes down to incidentals (aka match making).

![Job search infogrampic](/static/images/2024-02-25-job-search.png)

Some take-aways: I was surprised I didn't make it through the funnel for any of the startups, it was only the publicly traded, mature companies that considered me all the way through the interview funnel. I don't know why this was the case, but my gut says it is because startups superficially copy the interview process from bigger companies, but without the internal validation processes, or maybe it was ageism—I'm a greybeard now. I had one interviewer ask me “how many dependents will you have on your healthcare plan” which I responded with “uhh, that question is actually illegal to ask” he stumbled back with “Oh, I ask because our individual plan is good, but our family plan isn't good”—he went on to describe their company culture as “we hustle, we're usually in the office 6-days a week and long nights”. They're clearly drinking from the hustle culture Kool-Aid.

## Advice Column

I'll end with some advice to those still searching for work: Reach out to ex-coworkers and simply ask for LinkedIn references, endorsements, and just catch up with people. It'll be good to reconnect, and you can provide moral support and references for each other. These networks work. Ask Yourself Whats next. If you’ve never thought about where you’d like to be in three years, go for a walk and think about it. If you find it hard to wake up excited about going to work in the mornings, ask yourself why, and give yourself space to think about it. Ask yourself what skills you want to learn, and start to learn them by doing a project. Don't just learn for learning sake, but apply it to a project, even if an artificial one. Reflect upon your time at the company, summarize and write down a narrative of your time there that you can use during interviews to describe your experience. Focus on your milestones, challenges, learnings, mistakes, growth and accomplishments. Write a career narrative answering the “Tell me about yourself / tell me about your career” question, it can be long, but also write a 1-2 minute summary that you can recite during interviews. Refine it with use.

There is a ton of great talent out there, and even more impostor syndrome. I fear that a lot of great talent will start to pivot their careers away from the tech industry. Just remember, everyone is getting rejections, don't take it personally.
