This talk was presented at the Boston Ember.js Community meetup at Salsify, Inc
about a unique usecase for deploying FastBoot in order to do server-side
rendering of Ember applications at scale.

I review traditional, single-page web applications, I discuss server-side
rendering by introducing Ember FastBoot. I showcase our architecture and provide
a quick summary of how we use FastBoot in production.
