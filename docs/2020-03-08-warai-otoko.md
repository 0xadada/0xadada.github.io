Áî∑<rp>(</rp><rt>„Åä„Å®„Åì</rt><rp>)</rp> </ruby> <rp>(</rp><rt>warai

in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_.

This lil' project is an animated SVG using CSS transforms to rotate the text.

The Laughing Man logo is an animated image of a smiling figure wearing a cap,
with circling text quoting a line from Salinger's novel _The Catcher in the
Rye_, which reads:

> "I thought what I'd do was, I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes."

This character deeply resonates with me; he/she is a corporate hacktivist
infiltrating micromachine manufacturing corporations that hide an inexpensive
cure to a debilitating disease in order to profit from their more expensive but
proprietary micromachine treatment. They are able to hide their physical
presence by editing themselves out of video feeds and surveillance systems in
real-time by by superimposing the animated logo over their face.

The Laughing Man logo has been co-opted by pop culture in advocacy for the
Electronic Frontier Foundation and the loose hacktivist collective Anonymous
(using the latter's motto <q>We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive.
We do not forget. Expect us.</q>
