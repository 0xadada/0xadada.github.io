Recently published a [documentary film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtDN0Gdk7w) based on my essay [The Disappearance of Lived Time](https://0xadada.pub/2024/05/01/the-disappearance-of-lived-time/).

> Drawing from Debord and Heidegger, this film examines our subjective experience of time throughout history. It reveals how the relentless pursuit of productivity has shaped society and our perceptions of time, creating a perpetual present driven by an autonomous economy and accelerated by surveillance capitalism. The film explores the societal obsession with busyness and advocates for reclaiming time and leisure to foster true human flourishing.
