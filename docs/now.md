  Say what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year.

I was [out of work for 160 days between October and March](/2024/02/25/a-year-of-tech-layoffs/).
It was stressful since the job market was very competitive, (cliche)
<span className="spoiler">but also a profoundly important period because it provided
some much needed space to reflect on life and otherwise do things that i didn't have time for.</span>
I've been woolgathering thoughts for a new essay on leisure,
idleness, lived time, and the attention economy for the last 3 years.
I'm currently writing the rough draft--and I'm very excited about this project.
I recently started a new role as Software Engineer at CrowdStrike, so it appears I landed up.
