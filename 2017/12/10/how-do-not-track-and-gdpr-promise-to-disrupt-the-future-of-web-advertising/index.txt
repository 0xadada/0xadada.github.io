b:T5be,Ad-networks are middlemen who facilitate a “triangle trade” between
content-providers, advertisers, and users. In this system, a content provider
(e.g. The Wall Street Journal) wishes to publish a news story to their readers.
Their costs include paying reporters, hosting the website, and they wish to be
paid by an advertiser. The advertiser (e.g. Chase Bank) wishes to get attention
to their product (e.g. a new savings account), by placing an ad in front of
users likely to open a savings account. The advertisers costs include designing
an ad, and paying the ad-network to place the ad on sites within the ad-network
(i.e. ad-networks have many sites, one of which is wsj.com). The user wishes to
read the latest news (preferably for free). The ad-network is a match-making
company, they (via tracking analytics) are able to see which users visit the
sites in their network of content-providers, and are able to instantly place an
ad for the Chase savings account to the user of the Wall Street Journal who has
a metrics profile most similar to other users who have opened a new savings
account recently. The ad-network matches advertisers to the users most likely to
buy something from the advertiser. When the ad is placed, the user sees the ad,
the ad-network is able to inform both Chase bank and the Wall Street Journal
that the ad was seen. Finally, the ad-network is paid by Chase, and the Wall
Street Journal is paid by the ad-network for hosting the ad.2:["$","article",null,{"className":"hentry h-entry","children":[["$","header",null,{"children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"entry-title p-name","children":"How Do Not Track and The EU GDPR Promise to Disrupt the Future of Web Advertising"}],["$","time",null,{"className":"display-date_published__A_L_d dt-published","dateTime":"2017-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","children":"Sunday December 10, 2017"}],["$","br",null,{}],["$","span",null,{"className":"h-card page_byline___vuXv","children":["by:"," ",["$","span",null,{"className":"page_author__cAd1d fn p-author p-name","children":"0xADADA"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"entry-content e-content","children":[["$","aside",null,{"children":["$","em",null,{"children":"It seems fitting that I write this article on #HumanRightsDay"}]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Privacy is a fundamental human right.
