<p>We are clearly in a divided country, but what is the nature of the divide? Each
side keeps placing the other in numerous rhetorically charged categories that
obscure the root of their separation. Are we divided by geography being <em>coastal
elites</em> or <em>fly over states,</em> or are we merely parties like Dems or GOP? It is
more likely that we are merely optimists and pessimists. It is also likely that
pessimists who take power can never flip and create optimism.</p>
<p>Peeling back the rhetoric, our divide is near the root of our value system where
we decide to believe whether people are inherently good or bad. Always the
optimist and running on a platform of hope, Obama, frequently said very plainly
he believes people are inherently good. A recent
<a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/opinion/why-rural-america-voted-for-trump.html">NYTimes op-ed</a>
quotes an astute baptist minister from the other camp who says: “The difference
between Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans believe people are
fundamentally bad, while Democrats see people as fundamentally good,”.</p>
<p>Believing someone to be inherently good or bad has profound impact on policy.
Pessimists, often religious, do not think all people are bad, but all are bad
until they are saved or reborn. If you are not saved, you do not deserve a
safety net. To walk among the unsaved, you need a gun at all time in any space.
Pessimism often runs with paranoia and can give way to resentment and vindictive
policy where integrity and constitutional beliefs are too easily sacrificed to
punish the other camp.</p>
<p>Common sense says that the economy is more likely to grow under optimism than
pessimism, but what is the resource democrats draw their strength from and is it
geographically concentrated? Optimism is supported by the philosophical and
economic concept of the public good. Philosophically, the public good is rights
like the freedom of speech while economically it is resources like a properly
funded public school system. The concepts are seldom explicitly taught even
among economic schools, but have been well outlined by thinkers like
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unconscious-Civilization-John-Ralston-Saul/dp/0684871084/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1485716776&#x26;sr=8-2&#x26;keywords=john+ralston+saul">John Ralston Saul</a>.
Due to the nature of the parties, blue states have more of it and red states
less.</p>
<p>Whether you practice or not, without even knowing it, we are first introduced to
the public good via religion. The stories of the Koran, the Bible, and the Torah
all strive to codify the public good. When religions overlap to reveal universal
truths, that is the philosophical arm of the public good. Gandhi said all
religions are true because all religions strive to have a relationship with the
public good. If an ancient religious text seems dated and not to be taken
literally, that is because what is good is in flux and constantly needs
progressive revision and the removal of interests. Adamantly promoting an
outdated, unreflected upon version of the public good to support an interest
creates pessimism.</p>
<p>The next great codification of the public good (and recognition of its
fragility) that we are exposed to is the United States Constitution. The
document is set up to prevent erosion or deliberate destruction of the public
good by outlining checks and balances to government bodies as well as containing
a strong bill of rights. The document can also be officially amended to reflect
the public good so it does not become as easily dated as a religious text.</p>
<p>But how does this all relate to the current divide within the country? Times of
American growth and prosperity have taken place during periods where a vast
majority have optimistically believed other people were inherently good without
being hyper conscious of it. Prosperity has also coincided with policy that
strengthened the resources of the public good so that they could be drawn upon
for optimism.</p>
<p>Economically, the public good is a vast network of resources holding immense
hard to quantify wealth so it has become a major target for kleptocracy and
looting. The public good is hard to notice and outline so that it becomes hard
to defend when it is stolen from such as the privatization of prisons or
privatization of essential services like fire departments. We are currently
seeing efforts to privatize public schools which may be the public good’s single
greatest resource for optimism.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize what should be public and what should be private
and to understand the benefits of both because they feed each other and help us
find balance. Private for profit institutions can never have the full goals of
public institutions and therefore cannot generate the same optimism that drives
prosperity. Public resources such as research are integral to business optimism
and make it easier for competitive private enterprises to start and grow. Due to
externalities, production often has costs not factored into the price of a good.
Protections from public institutions like the EPA create and maintain optimism
by assuring the public will not foot the bill down the road for the accumulated
destructive behavior of a corporation.</p>
<p>The pessimists have always been in this country, but they have never recently
been so strong. Previously, pessimism was mainly the product of religion,
particularly fire and brimstone versions of Christianity, but atheists and
agnostics also have to form a value system and need to see the public good to
become optimists. Optimism is harder when you are geographically further away
from the resources of the public good which is disproportionately concentrated
in cities due to high population density.</p>
<p>Numerous catalysts for pessimism exist and a very significant driver has been
terrorism created by economic unrest in unstable regions that have very weak
public institutions and resources. The priest sex abuse scandals have also been
very significant in destroying trust in a large institution that, whether you
are religious or not, still plays a large role in the public good. McLuhan-esque
changes to media have also weakened optimism and challenged the resolve of all
our public resources. Social media is more like algorithmic media and nth degree
negative stories get promoted to the fore generating pessimism and paranoia. Due
to the algorithmic promotion of stories, many people believe crime is increasing
while in actuality statistics show it to be decreasing.</p>
<p>Optimism and pessimism profoundly impacts policing. Who is more likely to shoot
an unarmed black man pulled over for a simple traffic violation, an officer that
believes people are inherently good or an officer that believes people are
inherently bad? Proper funding for public institutions like police departments
are integral to maintaining the public good which carries optimism. The funding
for these institutions has been ravaged by globalism via the inability to raise
taxes. The source of funding changes a municipal police department’s place in
the public good. Forcing officers to fund themselves from one by one ticketing
creates downward spiral of pessimism with consequences of series social unrest.</p>
<p>Gun rights can be looked at in the context of the inherently good or bad
construct. Citizens successfully move about coastal cities with optimism not
carrying guns by holding the belief other people are inherently good while many
rural dwellers (to pick a category name) do not believe they can visit the city
without a gun. They believe people are inherently bad, or work on a sliding
scale where some easy to recognize people are inherently bad. To hold an <em>other</em>
saved, they have to be vetted personally.</p>
<p>Coastal cities benefit economically from an upward spiral of optimism generated
by creativity that results from pursuing diversity and inclusion. This is all
made possible by believing people are inherently good. Strong optimism
correlated to key features of the public good helps coastal cities to easily
weather storms that directly effect their locals such as terror attacks in New
York or Boston. Distant pessimist locals are disproportionately shook despite
their distant location.</p>
<p>The current GOP, believing people are inherently bad, is a dead end and cannot
create optimism once they take power. The economic arm of public good holds
immense wealth and instead of keeping size in check, while recognizing its
importance, ideology has taken hold with a goal of destroying any optimism
supporting public good not tied down. Private business growth within GOP
ideology comes from the looting of the public good. Public institutions that
should remain public are privatized and protections are removed which create
externalities that will have to be paid for later by the public. Current GOP
policy does not create original prosperity, but rather only a transfer from the
public good to private hands.</p>
<p>This inherently good versus bad, optimism versus pessimism construct lies
beneath the rhetoric and hopefully is helpful to put a finger on exactly how we
differ within this divided country. The relation of the public good to optimism
and its associated prosperity hopefully can constructively guide policy to
narrowing the divide. Rural areas need the resources of the public good that
urban areas have been able to draw from if they are to conquer their pessimism.
Believing people are inherently good is a hard road to walk and there will be
bruising if not scares, but it is the true American way and path to sustained
prosperity.</p>
