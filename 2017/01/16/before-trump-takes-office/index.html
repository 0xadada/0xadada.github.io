<p>Before Trump takes office, I want to create a picture of the high-water mark,
something I can point to and say "That was how it was" without the fog of time,
or the distortions of propaganda and ideology. I was inspired by Sarah Kendzior:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fellow Americans, I have a favor to ask you. Today is November 18, 2016. I
want you to write about who you are, what you have experienced, and what you
have endured. Write down what you value; what standards you hold for yourself
and for others. Write about your dreams for the future and your hopes for your
children. Write about the struggle of your ancestors and how the hardship they
overcame shaped the person you are today. Write your biography, write down
your memories. Because if you do not do it now, you may forget. Write a list
of things you would never do. Because it is possible that in the next year,
you will do them. Write a list of things you would never believe. Because it
is possible that in the next year, you will either believe them or be forced
to say you believe them.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>‒Sarah Kendzior</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Spectacle of 2016</h2>
<p>The 2016 election was a farce and a tipping point where politics have finally
become an extension of what Guy Debord called "The
Spectacle"<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. Both "viable" candidates offered the same neoliberal flavor of
poison. It was a false choice between "Coke vs Pepsi."</p>
<p>Clinton campaigned on a platform powered by a misplaced faith<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> in Big
Data<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>. She spoke in a language of clinical rhetoric to nobody except Wall Street. She was a status quo
candidate that lacked vision, offering nothing except a hedge against the
fascism of Trump. Her speeches were empty, dispassionate and simply disengaged
from reality. Her campaign and the DNC were corrupt from the start, and they
didn't try to hide it.</p>
<p>In my view, Trump is an angsty teenager who uses knee-jerk reactions and emotion
to speak to those disgusted, disenfranchised, and ignored by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus">Washington Consensus</a>. The
Republican party nearly destroyed itself by failing to field a status quo
candidate from their own ranks. This opened a gap which Trump was able to fill
by speaking directly to the middle class fear of sliding into the lower classes.
This fear has been stoked by mainstream media after the economic crisis that
started in 2008 and has continued up to today.</p>
<p>The candidates lie, and we know they're lying, and they know we know they're
lying. It doesn't matter because there is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_history">no longer an alternative vision for the future</a>
and there is no longer any accountability for those in power.</p>
<p>If one thing is clear from this election, it is the contradictions inherent in
the policies that Trump wishes to enact, as well as the contradictions inherent
in Neoliberal Capitalism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump believes that government regulation is preventing economic growth in the
US and wishes to deregulate. Yet regulation is the people's best means to
prevent corporate abuses of power: It can be used to prevent job flight
abroad, as well as prevent tax-shelters, and incentivize hiring and
manufacturing at home.</li>
<li>Trump says he is against war abroad, and yet wants to deploy more troops to
Iraq and Afghanistan.</li>
<li>An inability to account for economic contradictions such as "overproduction
relative to demand", with unemployment due to automation and a shrinking of
discretionary spending in the middle class.</li>
<li>Military contradictions including rising tensions between the US, NATO, and
its military allies, as shown with the recent spying scandals revealed by
Edward Snowden; along with the increasing economic unsustainability of war.</li>
<li>Cultural contradictions including tensions between U.S.A. Judeo-Christianity,
Islam, and other minorities as we see a rising trend of anti-Muslim sentiment
growing in the "Alt-Right".</li>
<li>Social contradictions encompassing the increasing gulf between the so-called
‘American Dream’, the belief that everyone can prosper in America through hard
work, and the reality of American life (the fact that more and more people
can’t).</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems Trump could actually be a less "hawkish" president than Clinton (who
just wants to go to more wars to fill the coffers of companies involved with the
military industrial complex). Trump instead seems to want to "do business" with
Russia and China. The fear I have for Trump is not the "Hawkish Empire" that
Hillary Clinton would've brought with her, but instead a form of "Corporate
Fascism" where he pours fuel on the fire of trans-national capitalism, while
funding the NSA/FBI/CIA to go after those who dissent against a
corporate-sponsored deep-state.</p>
<p>In such a Intellio fascist nightmare, the U.S.A. uses it military might to act
as the private security arm of Boeing, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Chase &#x26; JP
Morgan. We will see a deeper criminalization of copyright infringement,
boycotting, and more forced-purchase agreements like the current "Mandatory
Health Insurance" programs that force taxpayers to use their income to buy
big-corporate services. At the same time, we will see a gutting of
"commonwealth" programs like the ACA, and Planned Parenthood. These programs
will not be abolished, but will instead be privatized much in the same way vast
portions of the Russian national state was privatized after 1989. In its wake we
will see the rise of a new corporate oligarchy.</p>
<p>This election I made a conscious decision not to debate my coworkers, friends
and family over the candidates or "the issues". The 2016 campaign pitted two
candidates against each other in a way that drastically simplified and framed
discourse in moral absolutes. These absolutes were curated and made digestible
for mainstream media and social media.</p>
<p>Only the ignorant deal in moal absolutes. Debate isn't debate when "the issues"
are carefully curated to frame the dialog as a decision between choosing evils
when they're both evil. Taking sides can only end in animosity towards each
other, and creates wedges in the very communities we need to be building for
when the time comes to fight against corporate-fascism. Most importantly, we
lose sight of the bigger picture when the majority is split across artificially
imposed lines. Now is the time we should be gathering forces in our local
communities with the friends, coworkers and families that actually impact our
daily lives. Think global; act local is a cliche, but it works, and it's our
best defense against the shitstorm to come.</p>
<h2>At Present</h2>
<p>I can freely drive from home to any state in the US, without interference from
the police or border patrol. Border patrol thinks they can have their way with
folks along the border, but it's just a hassle. TSA wastes time with security
theater at airports, but I can travel to any country without problem. Be polite,
say as little as possible, and the headache goes away.</p>
<p>When planes fly overhead, I sometimes look to the sky and wonder where those
travellers are going. I don't worry about drone strikes at home. When I hear
police sirens, I typically don't even notice, its probably a traffic infraction.
Don't talk to the police, but be polite and the headache (usually) goes away.</p>
<p>I don't believe that immigrants are rapists, killers and drug dealers. I believe
immigrants today are no different than the immigrants that built this country;
they're just people trying to take the opportunity to improve their lives.</p>
<p>I don't believe that terrorists want to fight us because they "hate our
freedoms" but instead they want to fight to protect their own way of life. I
believe terrorism is caused by a reaction to U.S. policies in the middle east
funding the (primarily) Saudi Arabian royal family. The royal family receives
military equipment to oppress its own people and extract local natural resources
(oil) at the expense of its own people. The royal family also sends money to the
Salafi movement, an ultra-conservative regressive form of Islam that is
destabilizing the middle east and is the root of Al-Queda, ISIL and the current
war in Syria. In exchange for a market for Saudi oil and military supplies, the
U.S. indirectly empowers the wider Salafi movement to fight against the West
while companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Pratt &#x26; Whitney, KBR, General
Electric, Honeywell, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumann profit from
demand generated by continual wars.</p>
<p>I refuse to succumb to divide and conquer tactics; when the oppressor uses
arbitrary difference to separate humanity and then pit them against one another
by granting one side rights and denying those rights to the other. These are
apartheid tactics. Separation, isolation, and alienation are inhumane tactics
that serve the interests of authority and power. The differences used to
separate can be based on race, nationality, religion, gender, sexuality, class,
political party, and merit. These differences should be embraced and celebrated,
not used to divide us. We are all 99% similar, and the differences are what make
us unique. If they attack our minorities, they attack us all. Our strength lies
in unity against bigotry, hatred, and fear. We are united as one people for the
good of all.</p>
<p>I refuse to engage in consumerist activism. I wont be buying Che Guevara
t-shirts to lend my personal brand more progressive looking street-cred.
I wont be cheering for corporations making donations to political causes when it
serves their bottom line<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>. These types of activism are counterproductive as
they subjugate real social activism via personal relationships into a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(Marxism)">relationship mediated by physical goods</a>
and associations to brands.</p>
<p>I refuse to acknowledge the DHS, CBP as necessary or helpful
to US national security, as defenders of the constitution or more generally as
upkeepers of the rule of law. At their worst, they're oppressive thugs for a
racist deep state.</p>
<p>I will express my opinions and disagreements with the U.S.A government as I
always have. I will continue to be anti-war, anti-drone, anti-neoliberal,
anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist, and violently anti-fascist (if the fascists
seek to impose oppressive rule here in the U.S.A.) Censorship isn't political in
the U.S.A. We address censorship as a market opportunity. When folks are
pirating movies, companies address that gap by providing a (relatively) cheap
service to make it convenient to pay for the movie. The rhetoric of alarm around
"Fake News" is alarming however. It's beginning to sound eerily similar to the
rationale the Chinese government is using to censor social media, the "danger of
rumors" causing fractures in social cohesion. I'm worried the Trump
administration will take a similar path.</p>
<p>I will oppose the reappropriation of language. I will not use terms they
redefine, nor use new terms they make<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-6" id="user-content-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup>. We must preserve the true meaning of
words, and reconsider the use of language to simplify discourse and bias our
perspectives.</p>
<p>The media, press, bloggers and social media are free to criticize the political
establishment; it's a national pastime. The Daily Show and Colbert Report are
built on getting laughs from the deep cynicism of the Left. I post my criticism
to my site, twitter, etc. and don't expect the police to visit my house, my
work, or to worry about them asking about the post the next time I get pulled
over for a traffic infringement or at border control. I'm relaxed when
expressing my views, I go to protests and engage in local politics. I consider
these acts to be part of my civic duty and expect the government to NOT ask
about my activities. An expectation otherwise would result in the erosion of
civic activity due to self-censorship- the most pernicious form of censorship
because the censorship has become internalized.</p>
<p>My associations with friends, family, coworkers and neighbors are private, and I
expect them to remain private. I worry about my peers, who continue to divulge
the nature of their personal relationships and love-lives to social media
companies. This is the slow commodification of relationships. I worry that these
companies (Facebook, Tinder, etc) are increasingly mediating cherished
relationships between people.</p>
<p>Obama deported more undocumented migrants than any previous administration, he
unilaterally dropped ~26,000 bombs on Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and
other countries. I expect this to continue. I don't worry about going to war,
either at home or abroad. War has been a venture for the Washington Consensus to
control foreign access and control to natural resources and access to markets
for our trans-national corporate interests. This impacts the poor, those who
volunteer to fight, and immigrants who see a path to citizenship. The Consensus
seems wise enough to know the majority is war-fatigued, and fear protest or
resistance if a draft was ever reinstated. I don't expect the middle class to
rally behind Trumps wars, and I certainly will never support his wars.</p>
<p>The worst aspect of the Obama administration is that it quelled the energy of
left-oriented grassroots movements. People thought "Oh, Obama is like me, hes
smart and he's got this covered." It kept the Left at ease, and this mindset
resulting in eight years of political inaction.</p>
<p>The one redeeming side-effect of the Trump administration is that it will reveal
the true nature of modern neoliberal power politics in the United States.
Trumps' administration will brazenly take action without the pretenses of
conciliatory compromise, or mutual respect for any existing political party or
an adversarial press. His administration will be the "Big Reveal" of the level
of corruption in our body politic. Trump will accomplish this by placing the big
influencers (who, up to this point, have been outside advisors) in direct
positions of power; e.g. Instead of having Exxon Mobile acting as an external
industry advisor, Trump will make him the CEO the Secretary of State. These acts
will tear down the facade of a disinterested political apparatus and reveal the
true nature of politics rigged from top down to reward the biggest corporations.
This will help the Left appeal to the middle by pointing out readily apparent
and brazen corrpution.</p>
<p>During difficult times, there is a blossoming of arts and culture in response to
authoritarian oppression. While I have no expectations for positive reform in
federal politics, I have high hopes for local community action and the arts.</p>

It doesn't matter because there is\n\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_history\"\u003eno longer an alternative vision for the future\u003c/a\u003e\nand there is no longer any accountability for those in power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf one thing is clear from this election, it is the contradictions inherent in\nthe policies that Trump wishes to enact, as well as the contradictions inherent\nin Neoliberal Capitalism:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTrump believes that government regulation is preventing economic growth in the\nUS and wishes to deregulate. Yet regulation is the people's best means to\nprevent corporate abuses of power: It can be used to prevent job flight\nabroad, as well as prevent tax-shelters, and incentivize hiring and\nmanufacturing at home.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTrump says he is against war abroad, and yet wants to deploy more troops to\nIraq and Afghanistan.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn inability to account for economic contradictions such as \"overproduction\nrelative to demand\", with unemployment due to automation and a shrinking of\ndiscretionary spending in the middle class.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMilitary contradictions including rising tensions between the US, NATO, and\nits military allies, as shown with the recent spying scandals revealed by\nEdward Snowden; along with the increasing economic unsustainability of war.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCultural contradictions including tensions between U.S.A. Judeo-Christianity,\nIslam, and other minorities as we see a rising trend of anti-Muslim sentiment\ngrowing in the \"Alt-Right\".\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSocial contradictions encompassing the increasing gulf between the so-called\n‘American Dream’, the belief that everyone can prosper in America through hard\nwork, and the reality of American life (the fact that more and more people\ncan’t).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems Trump could actually be a less \"hawkish\" president than Clinton (who\njust wants to go to more wars to fill the coffers of companies involved with the\nmilitary industrial complex). Trump instead seems to want to \"do business\" with\nRussia and China. The fear I have for Trump is not the \"Hawkish Empire\" that\nHillary Clinton would've brought with her, but instead a form of \"Corporate\nFascism\" where he pours fuel on the fire of trans-national capitalism, while\nfunding the NSA/FBI/CIA to go after those who dissent against a\ncorporate-sponsored deep-state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn such a Intellio fascist nightmare, the U.S.A. uses it military might to act\nas the private security arm of Boeing, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Chase \u0026#x26; JP\nMorgan. We will see a deeper criminalization of copyright infringement,\nboycotting, and more forced-purchase agreements like the current \"Mandatory\nHealth Insurance\" programs that force taxpayers to use their income to buy\nbig-corporate services. At the same time, we will see a gutting of\n\"commonwealth\" programs like the ACA, and Planned Parenthood. These programs\nwill not be abolished, but will instead be privatized much in the same way vast\nportions of the Russian national state was privatized after 1989. In its wake we\nwill see the rise of a new corporate oligarchy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis election I made a conscious decision not to debate my coworkers, friends\nand family over the candidates or \"the issues\". The 2016 campaign pitted two\ncandidates against each other in a way that drastically simplified and framed\ndiscourse in moral absolutes. These absolutes were curated and made digestible\nfor mainstream media and social media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the ignorant deal in moal absolutes. Debate isn't debate when \"the issues\"\nare carefully curated to frame the dialog as a decision between choosing evils\nwhen they're both evil. Taking sides can only end in animosity towards each\nother, and creates wedges in the very communities we need to be building for\nwhen the time comes to fight against corporate-fascism. Most importantly, we\nlose sight of the bigger picture when the majority is split across artificially\nimposed lines. Now is the time we should be gathering forces in our local\ncommunities with the friends, coworkers and families that actually impact our\ndaily lives. Think global; act local is a cliche, but it works, and it's our\nbest defense against the shitstorm to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAt Present\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can freely drive from home to any state in the US, without interference from\nthe police or border patrol. Border patrol thinks they can have their way with\nfolks along the border, but it's just a hassle. TSA wastes time with security\ntheater at airports, but I can travel to any country without problem. Be polite,\nsay as little as possible, and the headache goes away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen planes fly overhead, I sometimes look to the sky and wonder where those\ntravellers are going. I don't worry about drone strikes at home. When I hear\npolice sirens, I typically don't even notice, its probably a traffic infraction.\nDon't talk to the police, but be polite and the headache (usually) goes away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don't believe that immigrants are rapists, killers and drug dealers. I believe\nimmigrants today are no different than the immigrants that built this country;\nthey're just people trying to take the opportunity to improve their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don't believe that terrorists want to fight us because they \"hate our\nfreedoms\" but instead they want to fight to protect their own way of life. I\nbelieve terrorism is caused by a reaction to U.S. policies in the middle east\nfunding the (primarily) Saudi Arabian royal family. The royal family receives\nmilitary equipment to oppress its own people and extract local natural resources\n(oil) at the expense of its own people. The royal family also sends money to the\nSalafi movement, an ultra-conservative regressive form of Islam that is\ndestabilizing the middle east and is the root of Al-Queda, ISIL and the current\nwar in Syria. In exchange for a market for Saudi oil and military supplies, the\nU.S. indirectly empowers the wider Salafi movement to fight against the West\nwhile companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Pratt \u0026#x26; Whitney, KBR, General\nElectric, Honeywell, Raytheon, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumann profit from\ndemand generated by continual wars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI refuse to succumb to divide and conquer tactics; when the oppressor uses\narbitrary difference to separate humanity and then pit them against one another\nby granting one side rights and denying those rights to the other. These are\napartheid tactics. Separation, isolation, and alienation are inhumane tactics\nthat serve the interests of authority and power. The differences used to\nseparate can be based on race, nationality, religion, gender, sexuality, class,\npolitical party, and merit. These differences should be embraced and celebrated,\nnot used to divide us. We are all 99% similar, and the differences are what make\nus unique. If they attack our minorities, they attack us all. Our strength lies\nin unity against bigotry, hatred, and fear. We are united as one people for the\ngood of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI refuse to engage in consumerist activism. I wont be buying Che Guevara\nt-shirts to lend my personal brand more progressive looking street-cred.\nI wont be cheering for corporations making donations to political causes when it\nserves their bottom line\u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#user-content-fn-5\" id=\"user-content-fnref-5\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\"\u003e5\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e. These types of activism are counterproductive as\nthey subjugate real social activism via personal relationships into a\n\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(Marxism)\"\u003erelationship mediated by physical goods\u003c/a\u003e\nand associations to brands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI refuse to acknowledge the DHS, CBP as necessary or helpful\nto US national security, as defenders of the constitution or more generally as\nupkeepers of the rule of law. At their worst, they're oppressive thugs for a\nracist deep state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will express my opinions and disagreements with the U.S.A government as I\nalways have. I will continue to be anti-war, anti-drone, anti-neoliberal,\nanti-imperialist, anti-capitalist, and violently anti-fascist (if the fascists\nseek to impose oppressive rule here in the U.S.A.) Censorship isn't political in\nthe U.S.A. We address censorship as a market opportunity. When folks are\npirating movies, companies address that gap by providing a (relatively) cheap\nservice to make it convenient to pay for the movie. The rhetoric of alarm around\n\"Fake News\" is alarming however. It's beginning to sound eerily similar to the\nrationale the Chinese government is using to censor social media, the \"danger of\nrumors\" causing fractures in social cohesion. I'm worried the Trump\nadministration will take a similar path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will oppose the reappropriation of language. I will not use terms they\nredefine, nor use new terms they make\u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#user-content-fn-6\" id=\"user-content-fnref-6\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\"\u003e6\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e. We must preserve the true meaning of\nwords, and reconsider the use of language to simplify discourse and bias our\nperspectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe media, press, bloggers and social media are free to criticize the political\nestablishment; it's a national pastime. The Daily Show and Colbert Report are\nbuilt on getting laughs from the deep cynicism of the Left. I post my criticism\nto my site, twitter, etc. and don't expect the police to visit my house, my\nwork, or to worry about them asking about the post the next time I get pulled\nover for a traffic infringement or at border control. I'm relaxed when\nexpressing my views, I go to protests and engage in local politics. I consider\nthese acts to be part of my civic duty and expect the government to NOT ask\nabout my activities. An expectation otherwise would result in the erosion of\ncivic activity due to self-censorship- the most pernicious form of censorship\nbecause the censorship has become internalized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy associations with friends, family, coworkers and neighbors are private, and I\nexpect them to remain private. I worry about my peers, who continue to divulge\nthe nature of their personal relationships and love-lives to social media\ncompanies. This is the slow commodification of relationships. I worry that these\ncompanies (Facebook, Tinder, etc) are increasingly mediating cherished\nrelationships between people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObama deported more undocumented migrants than any previous administration, he\nunilaterally dropped ~26,000 bombs on Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and\nother countries. I expect this to continue. I don't worry about going to war,\neither at home or abroad. War has been a venture for the Washington Consensus to\ncontrol foreign access and control to natural resources and access to markets\nfor our trans-national corporate interests. This impacts the poor, those who\nvolunteer to fight, and immigrants who see a path to citizenship. The Consensus\nseems wise enough to know the majority is war-fatigued, and fear protest or\nresistance if a draft was ever reinstated. I don't expect the middle class to\nrally behind Trumps wars, and I certainly will never support his wars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst aspect of the Obama administration is that it quelled the energy of\nleft-oriented grassroots movements. People thought \"Oh, Obama is like me, hes\nsmart and he's got this covered.\" It kept the Left at ease, and this mindset\nresulting in eight years of political inaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one redeeming side-effect of the Trump administration is that it will reveal\nthe true nature of modern neoliberal power politics in the United States.\nTrumps' administration will brazenly take action without the pretenses of\nconciliatory compromise, or mutual respect for any existing political party or\nan adversarial press. His administration will be the \"Big Reveal\" of the level\nof corruption in our body politic. Trump will accomplish this by placing the big\ninfluencers (who, up to this point, have been outside advisors) in direct\npositions of power; e.g. Instead of having Exxon Mobile acting as an external\nindustry advisor, Trump will make him the CEO the Secretary of State. These acts\nwill tear down the facade of a disinterested political apparatus and reveal the\ntrue nature of politics rigged from top down to reward the biggest corporations.\nThis will help the Left appeal to the middle by pointing out readily apparent\nand brazen corrpution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring difficult times, there is a blossoming of arts and culture in response to\nauthoritarian oppression. While I have no expectations for positive reform in\nfederal politics, I have high hopes for local community action and the arts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003csection data-footnotes class=\"footnotes\"\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"footnote-label\" class=\"sr-only\"\u003eFootnotes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"user-content-fn-1\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendzior, Sarah.\n\u003ca href=\"https://thecorrespondent.com/5696/were-heading-into-dark-times-this-is-how-to-be-your-own-light-in-the-age-of-trump/1611114266432-e23ea1a6\"\u003eWe're heading into dark times.
