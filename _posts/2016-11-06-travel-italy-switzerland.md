While true for me at that time, for that trip; there is nothing magical about
travel itself that opens the mind to new perspectives nor helps to
"recontextualize existing systems of thought". One must be ready and "in the
mood" to open ones mind and experience life from a new perspective.

The distance travelled is of no importance when the most distant places on
Earth can be connected to within a 24-hour period and a few short layovers.
The travel doesn't even begin until you have arrived at your destination.
Perhaps its how the distances are percieved that really matters. If ones
perception of 2,400 miles is two mediocre movies and a few bad in-flight
meals, perhaps its not really "travel".

Its October 2016. I have the luxury of quitting my job at an Artificial
Intelligence startup in Cambridge that I've been helping to build for the last
four and a half years. I'm ready for some serious alone-time, away
from computers, the internet, and people. I need time to myself, time to have
unstructured thought, time to get outside my own skull. I've got a little more
than two weeks of unscheduled time to tramp around from Italy into Switzerland.

This trip was about actually travelling between places on my own feet. Navigating
terra incognita by push my own limits- setting a goal on the horizon and getting
there by any means. My goal was to hike across the border from italy into
Switzerland via the Italian/Swiss Alps.

Importantly, this trip wasn't about setting off on a "Hero's Journey", to return
home a changed man, but to spend time alone to better understand myself. It was
a journey inwards. More than anything else, I had ample time to myself, whole days
went by without talking to anyone. I learned to be kind & gentle with myself, to
calm my own anxieties when stressed, to assess reality with facts and realize
only my actions will have any impact on the outcomes. To foster a feeling of
contentment with what **is**, not what could or may be. These are things I discovered
not out on the road, or on a mountain path, but within myself. These learnings
are not discoverable by going farther, or hiking higher, but by allocating time
and opening oneself to finding them. One has to both open the door, but then be
willing to walk through the doorway.

Travel is just a big distraction of novelty and the remarkable. It's easy to forget
everything and be immersed in the distraction. So if you are looking for something
inwards, be prepared to focus on whats inside, not whats outside. Travel
can be an escape from oneself or ones responsibilities, an escape more powerful
than other forms of escape.

In the end, travel for self-improvement is snake-oil just as any other form of
organized, packaged, advertised and productized self-improvement (e.g. self-help
books, expensive Yoga classes, meditation get-aways, therapy sessions, magical potions
and boner pills). The real work can't be bought, it must be practiced- and you
don't need to leave the house to do it. Travel doesn't change personal growth
any more than puzzels improve intellectual growth.
