This build is my vision of what a Subaru BRZ Type RA would've been,
[if Subaru actually released one](https://0xadada.pub/2020/10/20/the-type-ra-subaru-cant-build/).
The "Type RA" in Subaru parlance means "Record Attempt", it is the rawest form of the model lineup,
their design decisions are to make it lighter, simpler, and oriented towards the track more than
anything else.
