This talk is a code walkthrough, implementing a date picker to showcase the
power of ember-changeset and contextual components. Given at the Ember Boston
Community meetup.

Ember-changeset is an addon that provides an abstraction over Ember models such
that only valid data will ever be set in a model.

Contextual components are a set of conventions that allow a developer to build a
component that can be customized by its consuming application. This means they
can both yield values to its consumer, and allows a consumer to customize the
display of the component.
