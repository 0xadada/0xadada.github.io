Like 2009, the (coming/arriving) financial collapse of 2020 will reveal the 
asymmetry of power between the financial sector and the rest of the economy, and
it'll especially highlight how the financial sector is continually privatizing
profits and socializing losses.

When you see terms in the media about the Fed "expanding its balance sheet" 
think: _"The Fed is literally buying failed financial instruments to prevent
banks and financial companies from going out of business"_<sup>☨</sup>. 

Remember the Microsoft Zune mp3 player? Probably not, because it failed
horribly. Now imagine Microsoft had put so much investment into its Zune, that 
when nobody bought it, and the product failed, the company would've gone 
bankrupt. Now, if this were the financial sector, this is where the Fed becomes 
the Dealer of Last Resort, steps in and buys all the Zune mp3 players, saving 
Microsoft from going bankrupt.

This is exactly what the Fed is doing when it says it is "expanding its balance 
sheet"—its buying the failed assets the financial industry has created over 
the last 10 years, those very same assets the industry has made huge profits 
from; but now that the profits have stopped, the Fed bails them out buy buying
them when no one else will.

For the finance sector, the Fed provides **elasticity**: fungible rules around 
banking, investing, taxation, and bailouts when things go bad. For the rest of 
the economy, and individuals, we get **discipline**: austerity and cuts to 
social programs and public infrastructure, moralizing our individual failures 
as people, and continual indebtedness.

In this way the finance industry can reap the profits of risky financial 
instruments, but when the risk generates market failures, the Fed bails them out.
It's all upside, and no downside. This is the very definition of moral hazard. 
The financial industry literally cannot lose because the Fed will always save them.

In effect, this is Socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor.

> [Lemon socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_socialism) is a pejorative

So the imbalance: Why does the Fed continually save the financial industry every 
10 years, but not any other industry? Why does the Fed create and spend 1.5T 
dollars to purchase worthless and arcane financial instruments, but never spend 
on public goods like housing, student education, public infrastructure?

We, as a society are starting to understand that the financial sector is rotten
to the core, and this rot is going to seep into public sentiment: _"If they don't
play by the rules, why should I?"_. This has the effect or erroding the very
conception of a nation operating under an equal rule of law, and will result
in toxic resentment and fuel civil unrest.

## Notes

* <sup>☨</sup>: The Fed, according to [Section 14](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section14.htm)
  of the Federal Reserve Act
  prevents them from buying these assets directly, but effectively does so by
  granting the banking industry daily settlements at near-zero interest rates
  while the rest of the economy must pay higher interest rates.
