Software development, knowledge work, or most broadly any type of white collar labor is, primarily, the production of our own psychology.
Our mental capacity _is_ our means of production.
We embody the values of our work.
Our identity is tightly bound up with our careers, knowledge, skills, methods, company, and our industry—_we are our work_.

Having our identities bound to our work, and most dangerously,
to an employer severely limits ones ability to negotiate wages when that identity is immediately laid bare in monetary value—_our human value is our wage_.

Beyond wages, this mindset limits the horizons of what is possible to do with our own lived time.

> "I need to do software development forever, I am a software developer".

We can create art with software, we can also create software as art, we can also choose to _not_ make software,
and we are still the same person.
Software is something we create; we also create ourselves.

As someone who has spent a lifetime in software development, who has credentials in the field, and who's hobbies and interests have,
at various times, fallen into the bin of "software development",
I have often identified my worth with my current job, wage, and employer.
I have put all my eggs in one basket.
Identifying who we are with _what we do_ is a cognitive limit.

This is to say, I refuse to only self-understand muself as invested in my work, my career,
My achievements. This might have once been okay where we talked about the idea as a career
as a vocation, but the only horizon of intelligibility available according to the dominant mindset
is one where we understand
our selves only in terms of pure utility, or economic productiveness. This I refuse.

I _do_ software development. I am not a software developer.
