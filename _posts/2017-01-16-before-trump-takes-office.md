Before Trump takes office, I want to create a picture of the high-water mark, 
something I can point to and say "That was how it was" without the fog of time,
or the distortions of propaganda and ideology. I was inspired by Sarah
Kendzior:

> Fellow Americans, I have a favor to ask you.  Today is November 18, 2016.  I

> hardship they overcame shaped the person you are today.  Write your biography,
> write down your memories.  Because if you do not do it now, you may forget.
> Write a list of things you would never do.  Because it is possible that in the

> Because it is possible that in the next year, you will either believe them or

## The Spectacle of 2016

The 2016 election was a farce and a tipping point where politics have finally become
an extension of what Guy Debord called "The Spectacle"<sup>[2](#2)</sup>.
Both "viable" candidates offered the same neoliberal flavor of poison. It was a
false choice between "Coke vs Pepsi".

Clinton campaigned on a platform powered by a misplaced faith in Big Data. She
spoke in a language of clinical rhetoric to nobody except Wall Street.  She was
a status quo candidate that lacked any vision, offering nothing except
a hedge against the fascism of Trump.  Her speaches were empty, dispassionate and
simply disengaged from the reality of life in most of the United States.
Her campaign and the DNC was corrupt from the start, and didn't try to hide it.

Trump is simply an angsty teenager who uses knee-jerk reactions and emotion
to speak to those disgusted, disenfranchised, and ignored by the Washington
Consensus.  The Republican party nearly destroyed itself by failing
to field a status quo candidate from their own ranks. This opened a gap
which Trump was able to fill by speaking directly to the middle class fear
of sliding into the lower classes. This fear has been stoked by mainstream media
after the economic crisis that started in 2008 and has continued
up to today.

The candidates lie, and we know they're lying, and they know we know they're lying.
It doesn't matter because there is no longer an alternative vision for the future
and there is no longer any accountability.
 
If one thing is clear from this election, its the contradictions inherent in the
policies that Trump wishes to enact, as well as the contradictions inherent in
Neoliberal Capitalism:

* Trump believes that government regulation is preventing economic growth in the US
  and wishes to deregulate. Yet regulation is the peoples best means to prevent
  corporate abuses of power: It can be used to prevent job flight abroad, as well
  as prevent tax-shelters, and incentivize hiring and manufacturing at home.
* Trump says he is against war abroad, and yet wants to deploy more troops to Iraq and
  Afghanistan.
* The contridiction of an inability to account for economic contradictions such as
  "overproduction relative to demand", with unemployment due to automation and a
  lack of discretionary spending in the middle class.
* Military contradictions including rising tensions between the US, NATO, and
  its military allies, along with the increasing economic unsustainability of
  war.
* Cultural contradictions including tensions between US Judeo-Christianity,
  Islam, and other minorities.
* Social contradictions encompassing the increasing gulf between the so-called
  ‘American Dream’, the belief that everyone can prosper in America through
  hard work, and the reality of American life (the fact that more and more
  people can’t).

It seems Trump could actually be a less "hawkish" president than Clinton (who
just wants to go to more wars to fill the coffers of companies involved with the 
military industrial complex). Trump instead seems to want to "do business"
with Russia and China. The fear I have for Trump is not the "Hawkish Empire" that
Hillary Clinton would've brought with her, but instead a form of "Corporate Fascism"
where he pours fuel on the fire of trans-national capitalism, while funding the
NSA/FBI/CIA to go after those who dissent against a corporate-sponsored deep-state. 

In such a Intelliofascist nightmare, the US uses it military might to act as the
private security arm of Boeing, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Chase & JP Morgan. 
We will see a deeper criminalization of copyright infringement, boycotting, and
more forced-purchase agreements like the current "Mandatory Health Insurance"
programs that force taxpayers to use their income to buy big-corporate services. At
the same time, we will see a gutting of "commonwealth" programs like the ACA and
Planned Parenthood. These programs will not be abolished, but will instead be
privatized much in the same way vast portions of the Russian national state
was privatized after 1989. In its wake we will see the rise of a new corporate
oligarchy.

This election I made a conscious decision not to debate my coworkers, friends and
family over the candidates or the issues.  Debate isn't debate when "the issues"
are choosing between two evils: They're both Evil. It was bullshit that can only 
end in animosity towards each other, and creates wedges in the very communities 
we need to be building when the time comes to fight back against corporate-fascism.  

Instead of having debate around curated issues, issues framed and made digestable
by a media that benefits from eyetime generated by theatrical politics, we should
be gathering forces in our local communities with the friends, coworkers and families
that impact our daily lives.  Think global; act local is a cliche, but it works, and
its our best defense against the shitstorm to come.


## Looking Back

I can freely drive from home to any state in the US, without interference from
the police or border patrol. Border patrol thinks they can have their way with folks
along the border, but its just a hassle. TSA wastes time with security theater
at airports, but you can travel to any country without problem. Be polite, say 
as little as possible, and the headache goes away.

When planes fly overhead, I sometimes look to the sky and wonder where those
travellers are going. I don't worry about drone strikes at home. When I hear
police sirens, I typically don't even notice, its probably a traffic infraction.
Don't talk to the police, but be polite (being respectful is different) and the
headache goes away.

Censorship isn't political in the US. The US addresses censorship as a market
opportunity. If folks are pirating movies, then companies service that gap by providing
a (relatively) cheap service to make it convenient to pay for the movie. It seems
the biggest addressed form of censorship in the states is peoples choice to NOT
buy something. The rhetoric of alarm around "Fake News" is alarming however. It echoes the
rationale the Chinese government used to censor social media due to "rumors" causing
fractures in social cohesion. Perhaps the Trump administration will take a similar
path.

The media, press, bloggers and social media are free to criticize the political
establishment; its a national pastime. The Daily Show and Colbert Report are built on
getting laughs due to the deep cynicism of the Left. I post my criticism to my site,
twitter, etc and don't expect the police to visit my house, my work, or to worry
about them asking about the post the next time I get pulled over for a traffic
infringement or at border control. I feel relaxed to voice my opinion, go to protests
and engage in local politics. I consider these acts to be part of my civic duty and
expect the government to NOT ask about my activities. An expectation otherwise would result
in the erosion of civic activity due to self-censorship- the most pernicious form of
censorship.

My associations with friends, family, coworkers and neighbors are private, and
I expect them to remain private. I worry about my peers, who continue to 
dilvulge the nature of their personal relationships and love-lives to social
media companies. This is the slow commodification of relationships. I worry
that these companies (Facebook, Tinder, etc) are increasingly mediating 
cherished relationships between people. 

Obama deported more undocumented migrants than any previous administration, he
unilaterally dropped ~26,000 bombs on Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and other
countries. I expect this to continue. I don't worry about going to war, either
at home or abroad. War has been a venture for the Washington Consensus to 
control foreign access and control to natural resources and access to markets
for our trans-national corporate interests. This impacts the poor, those who
volunteer to fight, and immigrants who see a path to citizenship. The Consensus
seems wise enough to know the majority is war-fatigued, and fear protest
or resistance if a draft was ever reinstated. I don't expect the middle class
to rally behind Trumps wars, and I certainly will never support his wars.

During difficult times, there is a blossoming of arts and culture
in response to authoritarian oppression. While I have no expectations for
positive reform in federal politics, I have high hopes for local
community action.
