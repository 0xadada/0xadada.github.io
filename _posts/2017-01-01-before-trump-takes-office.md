Its the last few days of 2016, Christmas was on Sunday, and only five people
were in the office today as most people are taking the whole week off since
New Years is this coming Sunday.  A year ago today we had taken an easy flight
to Ireland and were exploring downtown Dublin.  We rented a car and drove around
the whole country for 10 days.  We visited friends in Florida for my birthday,
you went to Austin Texas and I went to Portland Oregon.   I backpacked through
Italy and Switzerland, visiting friends and making new ones along the way.  It
was a big year of changes too.

You changed careers and started grad school, and I changed jobs.  These changes
were our choices, choices made to improve the quality of our lives, and we made
them together.  We've been discussing having children, but the costs of daycare
are roughly $2200/mo on average, and that worries us.  We joke that we'll need 
to take out loans just to pay for daycare, but paying for college is a scary
thought, the value seems questionable and the prices are out of reach for any
family making less than $200k/yr.  Graduating in debt simply shackles our 
students to taking the career that will pay the most, and hardly encourages
learning the humanities; it instead focuses on learning techniques that will
be used in service to capital for the highest bidder.  They tell us civics are
less important when civic society is bankrupt.  I argue that is precicely when
civics are the most important.

This 2016 election is the tipping point where politics has become complete 
theater.  Both "viable" candidates offered the same neoliberal flavor of 
poison "Coke vs Pepsi".  The Republican party destroyed itself by failing
to field a "status quo" candidate from their own ranks, and left a gap open
that Trump was able to fill by speaking to the fear that mainstream media has
stoked in the population of middle and lower class people living in the
United States after the economic crisis that started in 2008 and has continued
to today.  Clinton spoke clinical rhetoric to nobody except Wall Street, she was
the status quo candidate that lacked any vision and offered nothing except a
hedge against the fascism of Trump.  Her campaign was corrupt from the start and
didn't try to hide the fact that the DNC was rigged to award her (over Sanders)
from the start. The candidates lie, and we know they're lying, and they know we
know they're lying. It doesn't matter because there is no longer an alternative
vision.

Twitter is continually abuzz with discussion about the problems with the
elections, and the candidates and the complete denigration of the electoral
process; and yet nothing changes.  It simply doesn't matter that everyone knows
its bullshit because nothing will change.  The institutions in power continue
to have power until the middle and lower classes are so disenfranchised and 
have nothing left to loose that to change everything only means to gain. Until
that happens, nothing will change.

If one thing is clear from this election, its the contradictions inherent in the
policies that Trump wishes to enact as well as contradictions in the system of
Capitalism itself:

* He believes that government regulation is preventing economic growth in the US
  and wishes to deregulate. Yet regulation is the peoples best means to prevent
  corporate abuses of power: It can be used to prevent job flight abroad, as well
  as prevent tax-shelters and incentivize hiring and manufacturing at home.
* He is against war abroad, and yet wants to deploy more troops to Iraq and
  Afghanistan. 
* The inability to account for economic contradictions such as "overproduction
  relative to demand", with unemployment due to automation and a lack of
  discretionary spending in the middle class.
* Military contradictions including rising tensions between the US, NATO, and
  its military allies, along with the increasing economic unsustainability of
  war
* Cultural contradictions including tensions between US Judeo-Christianity,
  Islam, and other minorities;
* Social contradictions encompassing the increasing gulf between the so-called
  ‘American Dream’, the belief that everyone can prosper in America through
  hard work, and the reality of American life (the fact that more and more
  people can’t).

It seems Trump could actually be a less "hawkish" president than Clinton (who
just wants to go to more wars to fill the coffers of companies involved with the 
military industrial complex). Trump instead seems to want to "do business"
with Russia and China. The fear I have for Trump is not the "Hawkish Empire" that
Hillary Clinton would've brought with her, but instead a form of "Corporate Fascism"
where he pours fuel on the fire of trans-national capitalism, while funding the NSA/FBI/CIA
to go after those who dissent against a corporate-sponsored deep-state.  In this nightmare,
the US uses it military might to act as the private security arm of Boeing, Microsoft,
Google, Facebook, Chase & J.P. Morgan.  We will see a deeper criminalization of copyright
infringement, boycotts, and more forced-purchase agreements like the current "Mandatory
Health Insurance" rackets that force taxpayers to use their hard-earned money
to buy a service that provides no service.

This election I made a conscious decision not to debate my coworkers, friends and
family over the candidates or the issues.  Debate isn't debate when "the issues"
are choosing between two evils: They're both Evil. It was bullshit that can only end in
animosity towards each other, and creates wedges in the very communities we need
to be building when the time comes to fight back against corporate-fascism.  

Instead of having debate around issues that are curated, framed and made digestable
by a media that benefits from eyetime generated by theatrical politics, we should
be gathering forces in our local communities with the friends, coworkers and families
that impact our daily lives.  Think global; act local is a cliche, but it works, and
its our best defense against the bullshit to come.
