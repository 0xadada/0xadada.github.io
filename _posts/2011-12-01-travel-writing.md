Travel opens my mind to new perspectives and allows me to
recontextualize existing systems of thought.

I had casually studied Roman history over the course of a few years, prior
to my travels to Italy. My understanding was built upon
a small collection of books and two [excellent](http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/)
[podcast](http://12byzantinerulers.com/) series. While one can learn a
great deal from  books, podcasts, and other media, that knowledge is
divorced from its original context &mdash; i.e. we musn't mistake a map
for the territory.

A museum - by its very nature - strips the subject of its
contextual time and place (arguably the time, and sometimes place have
been lost to time). A museum succeeds if it is able to recreate the context
of the subject in both time and place, within the mind of the museum visitor.
This leads to a more delightful understanding and appreciation of the
subject.

When I travel, I seek to create new understanding - a recontextualization
of the artifacts of knowledge I grasp on the subject. From facts and
anecdotes taken from books, images and perspectives gathered from
museums &mdash; all mashed together again, and then reformed within the
milieu of their original spatial context.

Its important to note that this is a passive activity, simply walking
around Rome was enough to ignite this recontextualization. Characters
take on new roles, events have more (or less) relevance, and places are
imbued with life, color and motion. Understanding becomes alive.

Travel seems to make me step outside the world, so that I can look back
upon it with new eyes. And when I return home, my new eyes are the eyes
with which I've always viewed the world.
