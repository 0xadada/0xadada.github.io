> "In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life
> presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was
> directly lived has moved away into representation." <cite>Guy
> Debord<sup class="Ref" id="ref:cite:1">[[1](#cite:1)]</sup></cite>

> "The Spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social relation among

Debord observed that the spectacle actively alters human interactions and
relationships. Images influence our lives and beliefs on a daily basis;
advertising manufactures new desires and aspirations. The media interprets (and
reduces) the world for us with the use of simple narratives. Photography and
film collapses time and geographic distance — providing the illusion of
universal connectivity. New products transform the way we live<sup
class="Ref" id="ref:cite:2">[[2](#cite:2)]</sup>.

Debord’s notions can be applied to our present-day reliance on technology. When
you search for a spot to spend the night out with friends, Yelp nudges your
group to search for the new bar selling great craft cocktails. What do you do
when you get lost in a foreign city? Do you ask a passer-by for directions, or
consult Google Maps? Perhaps Siri can help. When planning that upcoming
vacation, do the apps we use help us search for places and sights free to
explore, or where to get hotels and restaurants where we will conduct business
transactions? Such technology is incredibly useful, but it also subtly engineers
our behavior. It reduces our lives into a daily series of commodity
exchanges<sup>[[2](#cite:2)]</sup>.

Debord would not be surprised (and yet horrified) by companies such as Facebook,
Google and Twitter gradually changing us all into brand ambassadors, monetize
our friendships, opinions and emotions (further mediated through images of Emoji
🤷). Our internal thoughts and experiences are increasingly becoming
commodifiable assets and "engagements" to be touted at board meetings.

The spectacle, which is driven by economic interest and profit, replaces lived
reality with the “contemplation of the spectacle.” Being is replaced by having,
and having is replaced by appearing. We no longer live. We aspire. We work to
get richer. Paradoxically, we find ourselves working in order to have a
“vacation.” We can’t seem to actually live without working. Capitalism has thus
completely occupied social life<sup>[[2](#cite:2)]</sup>.

The proliferation of images and desires alienates us, not only from ourselves,
but from each other.
