This is the OEM badge that appeared on the 2018 Subaru WRX Type RA edition, of which only 500 were made. The STI's Type RA suffix stands for Record Attempt, in reference to the highly modified WRX STI Type RA NBR that Subaru used to set a lap record at the N√ºrburgring Nordschleifes for a sedan at 6"57s. This was also the very same vehicle David Higgins drove at the Isle of Man TT course and set the record at 17"35s. This isn't anything new, as the Nissan Skyline team famously badged their GT-R R34 with a  "N√ºr-spec" emblem to mark their achievements at the Ring.

The production 2018 STI type RA got 5 more horsepower, slightly shorter 3rd gear ratio, inverted Bilstein front struts, carbon fiber roof and rear wing and 19" wheels with 245/35R19s and put the car on a tiny diet losing only 53lbs off the regular 2018 STI, which is still a beast at nearly 3,380lbs. For all that reduction, they still add nearly $12,000 to the price tag, pumping the monster up to the $50k pricetag. We've truly entered the age of postmodernism when the marketing team advertises "reduced" features and actually adds to the pricetag. Fat-free, gluten-free, and free-range, but you'll pay extra for it.

I however, am more interested in referencing the 2002 WRX STi Spec-C Type RA, which stood for "Rally Applicant". This car was stripped of all luxuries: sound system, air con, power windows & locks, trunk trim, airbags, underbody coating all in the name of weight reduction. It was 116lbs lighter than a base model WRX. It had a cool roof vent and a quicker steering ratio. It had hand-ported heads that flowed far better (note: when building the engine for the RASpec Impreza, I found a set of Spec-C heads, and they were my favorite part of that build.) It produced more power and yet remained affordable __because__ it was stripped down.

On this car, the RA badge is a reference to that 2002 WRX STi Spec-C Type RA, the purest and most raw form of the WRX. Oh, and I almost forgot, it stands for me, type "Ron A." üòè
