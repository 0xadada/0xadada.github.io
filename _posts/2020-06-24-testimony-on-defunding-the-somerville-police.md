Good Evening, my name is 0xADADA, I am a 10 year resident of Ward â–ˆ in
Somerville.

The first steps to address the problem of systemic racism in Somerville is
two-fold:

- Defund the police by at least 60% or more; and
- Hold the Mayor accountable to direct these funds to **non-disciplinary**
  social programs; and stop internal line-item transfers to the SPD.

The weapons and practices we use abroad always manage to find their way home.
We're seeing some of the torture and humiliations that occurred in Abu Ghraib
here at home in ICE detention centers and local police stations as evidenced by
the deaths of Sandra Bland and so many others.

Under to 1033 Program, military surplus such as guns, night-vision googles,
surveillance equipment, teargas, drones, LRAD, and kevlar body armor all of
which has been tested abroad is now sold or even given to our local police
forces. This militarization has lead to the increase of police violence
nationally, spanning a long history from the Watts Rebellion to Rodney King, the
Kneel Movement and most recently with #BlackLivesMatter. This is yet another
example of the cycle of racist imperialism coming home.

Dr. Casey Delehanty and colleagues at Gardner-Webb University found<sup>1</sup>
that districts that received the maximum 1033 transfers are twice as likely to
have police killings compared to districts that receive none.

There is little evidence that such militarization reduces crime, and
considerable evidence that it both alienates communities and escalates police
violence against their own population.

We're also seeing the effects of imperialism on our soldiers coming home and
finding the most relevant jobs in the police force, and yet their mandates are
diametrically opposed. Many of these soldiers carry the mental scars of war, are
being streamlined from the streets of Fallujah to the city blocks of the US with
little mental heathcare or transitional training.

It is therefore in the best interests of our community to demilitarize and
defund the police, and in doing so, we work towards a more **just** society that
applies to **all** members of our community.
