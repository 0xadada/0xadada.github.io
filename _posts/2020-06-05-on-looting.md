Looting is an _obvious_ response to the glorification of consumer products—
commodities in a society that worships conspicuous consumption. The very act of
looting is resistance to the celebrity status of these commodities and what they
imply: inanimate objects celebrated for the image, status, and privilege they
create, and the way that privilege is assumed to confer the protection of the
police, the army, and other forms of the states monopoly on armed violence.

What is the police? They are the active guards of the commodity, those dead
objects created by the labor of underpaid and exploited workers—the police have
the job to ensure that the products of this exploited labor remains a commodity.
These commodities have the magical property that these objects must be paid for,
instead of remaining mere passive and inanimate objects (sneakers, fancy
watches, iPhones & Teslas) that could be subject to anyone who comes along to
make use of them.

In rejecting the humiliation of being subjected to the police, looters are at
the same time rejecting the humiliation of being subjected to the
media-celebration and glorification of these dead objects (most often produced
during the exploitation of their own labor) into commodities.

Looting, in other terms, is both a rejection of the commodity and the violence
used to protect its spectacular status, and a Peoples Bailout by other means.
