I love bookmarklets, those small and elegant lines of javascript that you can bookmark
and which do random functions in the browser when clicked.

<code>uri-editor.js</code> is 1-line of HTML that'll run a text editor in your browser.

Drag the link into your bookmarks to save it as a quick browser-based editor tool for those
moments you need a quick editor nearby.
