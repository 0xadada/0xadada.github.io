I love bookmarklets, those small and elegant lines of javascript that you can
bookmark and which do random functions in the browser when clicked.

<code>uri-editor.js</code> is 1-line of HTML that'll run a text editor in your
browser.

Drag the link into your bookmarks to save it as a quick browser-based editor
tool for those moments you need a quick editor nearby.
