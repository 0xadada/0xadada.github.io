Gibsons ["San Francisco’s Slow-Motion Suicide"](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/san-francisco-decline-failed-government-policies/)
is worth reading, his take is that San Francisco has become too successful... inevitable to decline into 
some mediocre backwater due to "the rent is too damn high".

He paints a compelling vision of the ills of appalling levels of income inequality, the monoculture of 
white-male-American tech-workers, and the metastasis of the city into the "hinterlands of Antioch and Vallejo":  
the resulting 3 hour-long commutes: yet all these are (in his argument) the results of a conservative set of 
"not in my backyard" zoning laws that haven't kept up with the living force of the city.

Recently [a friend of mine](https://twitter.com/b_apothecary) packed his motorcycle up with his distillation laboratory, plastic molding equipment,
machine shop tools, his immense library, his formidable liqour collection, and moved down to Philadelphia, where 
he can have a far larger living space, workspaces are abundantly available, and where the barrier to start new 
businesses and develop existing vacant lots for new uses are minimal or non-existent.

Gibsons wonderful most powerful argument was this:
> The legendary urbanist Jane Jacobs once remarked that new ideas come from old buildings, the types of places 
> you can alter without permission because no one cares about them. This is one reason why so many garage startups 
> and garage bands and artists spilling paint in discarded warehouse lofts have left their mark on the world. 
> The true creative class can’t afford to rent expensive new studios.

Where Gibson is misguided is his reliance on the conservative zoning laws to explain the plight of San Francisco 
and similar cities. The problem in San Francisco isn't a lack of development, but the opposite: The lack of LIFE 
itself. San Francisco has privileged the physical static object of the real-estate-object over the use of space 
in time. The people owning property and businesses place more value of the real estate value over the use value, 
and the result is a static dead space where object-value is worth more than the use value of space in daily life.

The drive to urbanization is an imperative of capitalism, this drive results in "a freezing of life"— a static 
world devoid of spontaneity, the result of land development and bureaucratic zoning laws optimized for rent seeking 
and increased land valuations, devoid of nature and where its residents have no ability to change their surroundings 
to suit their daily ways of living. All desire for change is eliminated in order to serve the profit seeking imperative 
of Capital, all autonomy of local residential use is therefore foreclosed, instead privileging commercial development 
as the only legitimate use.

The result of this is a predominance of land use organized around the valuable placement of real estate objects over 
the living use and alteration of land by the very people who live in these spaces, people who wish to change their 
living spaces over time as use-patterns and ways of living change with the seasons and with time. This is a privileging 
of the orientation of space over the nature of change in the passage of time. The philosopher Hegel explored this 
concept saying:

> "Space is the connection of the quiescent asunderness and side-by-sideness of things [objects]; Time is the 
> connection of their vanishing or alteration... In the spatial world the question is not succession but of 
> coexistence... As a restless Becoming [Time] is not an element of the synthetic whole."
>
> <cite>(G.W.F. Hegel ; translated by A.V. Miller. Oxford, UK ; New York, NY : B. Blackwell, 1986.)</cite>

This is to say: the privileging of objects in space fetishizes the object and therefore sacrifices changes 
in time. This creates and alienated and static space of purely fetishized structures devoid of life.

This describes exactly what is happening in Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, and explains why moving to somewhere 
like Philidelphia opens us up to using spaces for daily life rather than being subjected to spaces that merely 
have real-estate-object value.
