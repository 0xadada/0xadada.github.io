From comic book stores to Facebook to message boards, it seems that the "Keep
Calm and Carry On" poster is living a new life as pop-culture cool while people
remix its' message with both quirky or banal messages.

This attempt tries to speak most directly to its underlying message of
consumerism, amidst the current climate of the Occupy Movement.
