This is the first set mixed in nearly 12 years. Working in an open
office space means many hours of my day are spent listening to music with
headphones on, cranking away at software code.

For me, this means listening to music that doesn't distract from the task
of writing and problem solving. This set was designed in the spirit of
[musicForProgramming.net](http://musicforprogramming.net).

This set was heavily inspired by sci-fi movies that use long scenes to 
showcase the vast, open, and cold expanses of space: Solaris, Interstellar,
and Gravity all come to mind.
