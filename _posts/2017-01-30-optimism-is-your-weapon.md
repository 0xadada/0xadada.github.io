We are clearly in a divided country, but what is the nature of the divide? Each
side keeps placing the other in numerous rhetorically charged categories that
obscure the root of their separation. Are we divided by geography being _coastal
elites_ or _fly over states,_ or are we merely parties like Dems or GOP? It is
more likely that we are merely optimists and pessimists. It is also likely that
pessimists who take power can never flip and create optimism.

Peeling back the rhetoric, our divide is near the root of our value system where
we decide to believe whether people are inherently good or bad. Always the
optimist and running on a platform of hope, Obama, frequently said very plainly
he believes people are inherently good. A recent [NYTimes
op-ed](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/opinion/why-rural-america-voted-for-trump.html)
quotes an astute baptist minister from the other camp who says: “The
difference between Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans believe people
are fundamentally bad, while Democrats see people as fundamentally
good,”.

Believing someone to be inherently good or bad has profound impact
on policy. Pessimists, often religious, do not think all people are bad, but all
are bad until they are saved or reborn. If you are not saved, you do not deserve
a safety net. To walk among the unsaved, you need a gun at all time in any
space. Pessimism often runs with paranoia and can give way to resentment and
vindictive policy where integrity and constitutional beliefs are too easily
sacrificed to punish the other camp.

Common sense says that the economy is
more likely to grow under optimism than pessimism, but what is the resource
democrats draw their strength from and is it geographically concentrated?
Optimism is supported by the philosophical and economic concept of the public
good. Philosophically, the public good is rights like the freedom of speech
while economically it is resources like a properly funded public school system.
The concepts are seldom explicitly taught even among economic schools, but have
been well outlined by thinkers like [John Ralston
Saul](https://www.amazon.com/Unconscious-Civilization-John-Ralston-Saul/dp/0684871084/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1485716776&sr=8-2&keywords=john+ralston+saul).
Due to the nature of the parties, blue states have more of it and red states
less.

Whether you practice or not, without even knowing it, we are first
introduced to the public good via religion. The stories of the Koran, the Bible,
and the Torah all strive to codify the public good. When religions overlap to
reveal universal truths, that is the philosophical arm of the public good.
Gandhi said all religions are true because all religions strive to have a
relationship with the public good. If an ancient religious text seems dated and
not to be taken literally, that is because what is good is in flux and
constantly needs progressive revision and the removal of interests. Adamantly
promoting an outdated, unreflected upon version of the public good to support an
interest creates pessimism.

The next great codification of the public good
(and recognition of its fragility) that we are exposed to is the United States
Constitution. The document is set up to prevent erosion or deliberate
destruction of the public good by outlining checks and balances to government
bodies as well as containing a strong bill of rights. The document can also be
officially amended to reflect the public good so it does not become as easily
dated as a religious text.

But how does this all relate to the current divide
within the country? Times of American growth and prosperity have taken place
during periods where a vast majority have optimistically believed other people
were inherently good without being hyper conscious of it. Prosperity has also
coincided with policy that strengthened the resources of the public good so that
they could be drawn upon for optimism.

Economically, the public good is a
vast network of resources holding immense hard to quantify wealth so it has
become a major target for kleptocracy and looting. The public good is hard to
notice and outline so that it becomes hard to defend when it is stolen from such
as the privatization of prisons or privatization of essential services like fire
departments. We are currently seeing efforts to privatize public schools which
may be the public good’s single greatest resource for optimism.

It is
important to recognize what should be public and what should be private and to
understand the benefits of both because they feed each other and help us find
balance. Private for profit institutions can never have the full goals of public
institutions and therefore cannot generate the same optimism that drives
prosperity. Public resources such as research are integral to business optimism
and make it easier for competitive private enterprises to start and grow. Due to
externalities, production often has costs not factored into the price of a good.
Protections from public institutions like the EPA create and maintain optimism
by assuring the public will not foot the bill down the road for the accumulated
destructive behavior of a corporation.

The pessimists have always been in
this country, but they have never recently been so strong. Previously, pessimism
was mainly the product of religion, particularly fire and brimstone versions of
Christianity, but atheists and agnostics also have to form a value system and
need to see the public good to become optimists. Optimism is harder when you are
geographically further away from the resources of the public good which is
disproportionately concentrated in cities due to high population
density.

Numerous catalysts for pessimism exist and a very significant driver
has been terrorism created by economic unrest in unstable regions that have very
weak public institutions and resources. The priest sex abuse scandals have also
been very significant in destroying trust in a large institution that, whether
you are religious or not, still plays a large role in the public good.
McLuhan-esque changes to media have also weakened optimism and challenged the
resolve of all our public resources. Social media is more like algorithmic media
and nth degree negative stories get promoted to the fore generating pessimism
and paranoia. Due to the algorithmic promotion of stories, many people believe
crime is increasing while in actuality statistics show it to be
decreasing.

Optimism and pessimism profoundly impacts policing. Who is more
likely to shoot an unarmed black man pulled over for a simple traffic violation,
an officer that believes people are inherently good or an officer that believes
people are inherently bad? Proper funding for public institutions like police
departments are integral to maintaining the public good which carries optimism.
The funding for these institutions has been ravaged by globalism via the
inability to raise taxes. The source of funding changes a municipal police
department’s place in the public good. Forcing officers to fund themselves
from one by one ticketing creates downward spiral of pessimism with consequences
of series social unrest.

Gun rights can be looked at in the context of the
inherently good or bad construct. Citizens successfully move about coastal
cities with optimism not carrying guns by holding the belief other people are
inherently good while many rural dwellers (to pick a category name) do not
believe they can visit the city without a gun. They believe people are
inherently bad, or work on a sliding scale where some easy to recognize people
are inherently bad. To hold an _other_ saved, they have to be vetted
personally.

Coastal cities benefit economically from an upward spiral of
optimism generated by creativity that results from pursuing diversity and
inclusion. This is all made possible by believing people are inherently good.
Strong optimism correlated to key features of the public good helps coastal
cities to easily weather storms that directly effect their locals such as terror
attacks in New York or Boston. Distant pessimist locals are disproportionately
shook despite their distant location.

The current GOP, believing people are
inherently bad, is a dead end and cannot create optimism once they take power.
The economic arm of public good holds immense wealth and instead of keeping size
in check, while recognizing its importance, ideology has taken hold with a goal
of destroying any optimism supporting public good not tied down. Private
business growth within GOP ideology comes from the looting of the public good.
Public institutions that should remain public are privatized and protections are
removed which create externalities that will have to be paid for later by the
public. Current GOP policy does not create original prosperity, but rather only
a transfer from the public good to private hands.

This inherently good versus
bad, optimism versus pessimism construct lies beneath the rhetoric and hopefully
is helpful to put a finger on exactly how we differ within this divided country.
The relation of the public good to optimism and its associated prosperity
hopefully can constructively guide policy to narrowing the divide. Rural areas
need the resources of the public good that urban areas have been able to draw
from if they are to conquer their pessimism. Believing people are inherently
good is a hard road to walk and there will be bruising if not scares, but it is
the true American way and path to sustained prosperity.
