In “Understanding Media<sup>[1](#1)</sup>,” McLuhan describes the shift in western
society from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy as a template for the
next shift from an industrial economy to an information economy.

He goes on to describe how farmers lived and worked on the land in the 
countryside. The rise of industrialization lead to a shift in the focus 
of labor activities to the factory and centers of production around the 
factory — the city or urban area. The invention of the train helped to 
leverage the growth of the cities by facilitating transportation between 
centers of production for both resources and labor. Similarly, the rise 
of the automobile and interstate highway systems directly resulted in 
the development of suburban areas.

McLuhan utilizes the agrarian-to-industrial economic shift as a template 
by which we will see the next shift; from an industrial economy to an information economy.

The (in his words) “electronic economy” or “information economy” (in modern 
words) will be a new economic/societal shift in which the information 
infrastructure (fiber optics, cheap hardware, ubiquitous internet access) 
will afford another shift from the centers of industrial production back 
to the countryside — ie: working remotely from your country home.

McLuhan in the dawn of the color-TV era, was widely seen as a visionary 
capable of seeing deep into societal shifts before they happened, and 
providing guidance as they unfolded. Perhaps his works should be revisited,
as they continue to provide useful insight.
