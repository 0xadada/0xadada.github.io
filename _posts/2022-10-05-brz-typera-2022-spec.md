In 2020 [I wrote about the potential of the Subaru
BRZ](/2020/10/20/the-type-ra-subaru-cant-build/) but its lack of a
track-oriented trim level:

> If we want a truely lightweight track-oriented weapon like the 2002 WRX STI
> Spec-C Type RA, we'll need to build it ourselves... or really, deconstruct the
> cars we have, in order to make one.

… so I built one myself.

It had been five years since I had owned a track car, it was the early months of
the COVID-19 pandemic, I was languishing, and my wife said "You need to do
something, you need to make your own happiness".

# Your Own Happiness

‟Your Own Happiness” is the name I've given to a 2017 Subaru BRZ purchased in
October 2020 with 66k miles. The build mission is a trackable street car with a
whole bunch of very subtle OEM+ aesthetic changes.

I've given myself a few principals to guide the build:

- The Subaru BRZ / Toyota 86 is a **perfectly balanced drivers car for those on a budget.**
- This build will be a trackable street car, in that order.
- Power is a band-aid for poor setup and lack of driving skill.
- Nobody is impressed if you can only pass in the straights.
- Weight and simplicity are key: Complexity means more maintenance, more weight, more cost, more heat, and more futzing at the track: reducing fun and seat time.
- A car that reinvigorates the idea of driving delight at an affordable price.
- Drive it to the track & back
- Make power with 93 Octane

After a six-month search for a used Crystal White Pearl Kouki (2017-2020)
BRZ or 86, I found one on the Subaru Certified Pre-Owned web portal in Annapolis
Subaru. I called them and immediately put down a deposit. I rented a car and
drove 11 hours on a Friday night, starting at 10pm, arriving at 9am Saturday
morning. The car was in great condition, and lucky for me, this was _just_ before
COVID-19 caused used-car prices to skyrocket.

Many, if not most of the performance improvement ideas were taken from my previous
[RASpec Impreza](/2015/08/15/raspec-impreza/) build, and applied to this car,
only simpler.

Thus far the car has seen 18 track days between racing & drifting, and has handled
them beautifully, with only a few minor issues.
It’s not making ridiculous amounts of power for a street car, keeping reliability
and affordability in check. Most importantly, it’s fulfilling its destiny as a
driver’s car, customised for its intended use and used well.

The car itself, the physical object—isn't what makes me happy, its the _involvement_ in
creating my vision with my own hands, it's the _participation_ in motorsports,
and of course the people and friends I make along the way. That is _my own happiness_.
What is yours?
