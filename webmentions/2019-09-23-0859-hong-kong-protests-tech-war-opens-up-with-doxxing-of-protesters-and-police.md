    The leak, however, represents just a small proportion of doxxing cases, which have skyrocketed
    in the past three months. Hong Kongâ€™s privacy commission said it had received 1,376 complaints
    and 126 enquiries between 14 June and 18 September regarding personal information being leaked
    online, according to Stephen Kai-yi Wong, privacy commissioner for personal data.

    While journalists have become a high-profile target, about 40% of cases involve police officers 
    while the rest concern government officials, community leaders, the families of police officers,
    and other citizens, Wong said.

It seems odd that the 60% remaining cases of reported doxxing are other
citizens, which could include protesters seemingly doxxed by the police
themselves. In this situation, the
[Privacy Commissioner of Hong Kong](https://www.pcpd.org.hk/) has the duty to
report the doxxing case back to the police, therefore snitching on the protester
about their complaint about doxxing by the police.

Thus the PCPD of Hong Kong is becoming an institutional informant to the police
state.
