@all2 : I&#x27;ve written an essay on my approach:  https://0xadada.pub/2015/11/05/a-retrospective-responsive-de...  but to summarize some of its main points: Responsive design is: * A process
* A relinquishing of the false sense of comfort we get when designing for a “design comp”
* An experience-first / MVP friendly approach to building dynamic, consistent and importantly a complete experience that adapts to users context
* A conduit for the flow of of communication, and much much like water, it flows into different browsers &amp; devices, flows into robot search engine crawlers, flows into RSS feeds, flows into meta-data (hReview) parsers, flows into printers, flows into read-later tools like Web Clippings, Pocket, Instapaper and FlipBoard Responsive Design isn’t a set of CSS features, a technology stack or a set of tools. Its when an organization decides to collaborate around a process; with accountability to the user first, to each other second, and to solve the technology last, once all important decisions have been made.
