</figure>
<p>Oscar the Grouch, a character from the popular children's television show "Sesame Street," can be seen as a modern-day embodiment of the Hellenistic philosophical tradition of Diogenes the Cynic. Like Diogenes, Oscar rejects the trappings of mainstream society and embraces a simpler, more ascetic lifestyle. In Oscar's case, this means living in a trash can and rejecting the consumerist values of capitalism.</p>
<p>In the words of Guy Debord, the creator of the concept of the "Society of the Spectacle," Oscar embodies a rejection of the false realities and empty spectacles of modern society. He lives outside the system, literally on the fringes of society, and does not participate in the relentless pursuit of material possessions and status.</p>
<p>Oscar's embrace of dumpster diving and his apparent lack of concern for hygiene and cleanliness can be seen as a rejection of the wastefulness and excess of capitalist society. In Marxist terms, the garbage that Oscar collects and lives among can be seen as the detritus of surplus value, the discarded byproducts of a system that prioritizes profit over all else.</p>
<p>As a critic of wider society, Oscar occupies a unique position. Living on the streets, he is literally on the front lines of climate change and other environmental issues. His rejection of mainstream values and way of life makes him a powerful symbol of resistance to the destructive forces of capitalism and consumerism.</p>
