<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Hikikomori (Jap. 引きこもり) and otaku (Jap. おたく) are considered today’s most
prominent social problems. Hikikomori refers to the recent state of middle and
high school students who drop out of school, and withdraw completely from
society. Otaku are the deeply obsessed fans of a particular subject who commit
their free time (and sometimes lives) to the complete memorization of their
obsession.</p>
<p>In both cases these groups are extreme exaggerations of common Japanese social
tendencies. The media in Japan is currently attacking these groups as harbingers
of social chaos, and portrays them as a new group of outcast who will destroy
society (at least kill many people). This portrayal is not only accepted by the
media, but by the society as well.</p>
<p>History has shown the Japanese social tendency to create outcast groups, isolate
them, and then blame current social problems on that group. These groups are
then used as examples of “The Other”, a group that is in opposition to the main
Japanese society. This “Other” is used to construct a national and cultural
identity by comparing it in opposition to the norm.</p>
<p>What defines a person as Japanese? If you asked a Japanese person today that
same question, they would have an easy time answering that question with a quick
“A Japanese person is a person from Japan.” This answer does not consider people
of foreign heritage born in Japan, such as Koreans, or children born from
migrant workers. If you want to be Japanese, you must look, speak, act, and most
importantly be by-blood, Japanese.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, while it is possible-though not particularly easy-for a foreigner
to acquire Japanese citizenship, it is not possible for an immigrant or the
children of immigrants to “become Japanese” the way such people can “become
American.” The way you get to be Japanese is the same way you get to be Zulu
or Shona in Africa: you have to be born into the tribe. For that is what the
people of Japan-or at least more than 97 percent of them-really are: members
of a single great tribe united not just by common citizenship or common
language but by common bloodlines, common racial memory and common tribal
codes, so of which stretch back into prehistory.</p>
<figcaption><cite>Christopher, Robert C., 51</cite></figcaption>
</blockquote>
<p>Japanese society distinguishes itself from other cultures based on in-groups and
out-groups. The groups that are not Japanese, not local, and different are
considered the out-groups. Local groups, family groups, and traditional groups
are considered Japanese. To define oneself as Japanese you must simply define
yourself as a member of the in-group, and others as members of the out-group.
This phenomenon has created an unconscious system of creating out-groups with
each generation in order to achieve national self-identity.</p>
<h2 id="the-past">The Past</h2>
<p>Looking into the past, we find a long tradition of an outcast system that has
continued right up until today’s modern society. With outcast groups such as the
Hinin (Jap. 非人) class starting in the Heian period, which evolved into
present-day Burakumin (Jap. 部落民), or Buraku. Later, Westerners were seen as
the new group of outsiders, bearing prosperity, change and new evils.</p>
<p>Later still we find the in surge of Koreans to fill the immediate need for
industrial labor.</p>
<p>In the last few decades, the outsiders haven’t been literally from the outside
of Japan, or from outside of the caste system, but instead from inside the
deeper parts of the society, the seemingly average citizen. These people are
deemed socially inept, different, and therefore put to the outside.</p>
<p>The Buraku has existed since the 11th century, originally with such names as eta
and Hinin. They first were considered members of a class outside of the
traditional caste system of Feudal Japan. Today they characterize many of the
same ways of life as they have in the past. Most of these people work in the
so-called Buraku industries of shoe making, dyeing, slaughtering animals and
handling their skins, providing laborers for crematory or graveyard work, and
scrap collection of all kinds. Buraku also participate in unskilled low-level
construction, garbage collection, street cleaning, as well as leather working.</p>
<p>Beginning with the Spanish and Portuguese seafarers in the mid-sixteenth
century, westerners were easily identified as the largest group of strangers, or
outsiders to the Japanese. While these people were easily identified as
outsiders because of their foreign origins, they were also outsiders because of
the way they were seen and accepted by society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the same time however, outsiders themselves were ambiguous figures, for
usually they were believed to possess both beneficent and malevolent powers.
The stranger our outsider might have skills pleasing or valuable to the
community and be the harbinger of good fortune in general, but he or she could
equally well be the bringer of calamity, the bearer of evil.</p>
<figcaption><cite>Dower, John., 234</cite></figcaption>
</blockquote>
<p>Koreans have been a largely disenfranchised group of Japanese society since
Korea was colonized in 1910. The situation of Koreans in Japan is that many were
brought into the nation as migrant unskilled laborers for the immediate needs of
the industrial revolution. The problem arises when considering the consequences
of a large group of foreign people who are thought of as never being able to
assimilate into a homogeneous society.</p>
<p>Japan today doesn’t allow Japanese-born Koreans to become citizens despite the
fact that their families have lived in Japan for up to three generations. The
Korean population is largely located in Osaka. There is currently a movement to
promote full citizenship to all resident Koreans, and equal status as a Japanese
citizen.</p>
<h2 id="the-present">The Present</h2>
<p>Koreans and Buraku are still considered out-groups in Japan today, however, they
aren’t nearly as publicly discriminated against as the more recent groups that
have been so popular in the media. Recently there has been a surge of
discrimination against groups of Japanese peoples within Japanese society. These
groups consist of socially divergent individuals who sometimes identify
themselves as members of a specific group. Such groups are the religious cults,
otaku and most recently the hikikomori.</p>
<p>The cult phenomenon in Japan has ties with the traditional Japanese connection
with self-identification with a specific group. These values go back to the
small villages that primarily grew crops, and survived as a group by trading
produce and services within the small-encapsulated society. These villages would
be self-sufficient and reluctant to welcome strangers into the group. The cult
phenomenon is similar in many ways. In the last fifteen years, cults have grown
in size as well as numbers, the most prominent being the Aum Shinrikyo (Jap. オ
ウム真理教). These cults are isolated from the rest of society, its’ members are
not allowed to communicate with the outside world. With the acts of terrorism in
1995 by this cult, cults are now seen as outsiders by the majority of Japanese
society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="note"><small>Otaku</small>おたく</span> have arisen out of the early 1980s as a new group of
mostly teenage and twenty-something year olds who share a common obsession.
The term Otaku is derived from its ancient meaning of addressing someone from
another household, and implies that you are unconcerned with the details of
the other persons family and circumstances. It prevented the discovery that
there were differences between ‘I’ and ‘You’.</p>
<figcaption><cite>Smith, 80-81</cite></figcaption>
</blockquote>
<p>Today the term is used to mean</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not interested in you or your inner life. I share with you only a narrow
interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usually the obsession is about an obscure topic such as a dead rock star, a
video game, an animated (anime) cartoon series, computers or internet. These
groups are seen as strange people who try to learn everything they can about an
obscure topic, and therefore are different, and should be avoided.</p>
<p>The Hikikomori are the most recent group of deviants whom are shown in the media
as the most troubled, and enigmatic. Similar to otaku in certain ways, these
people frequently have an obsession, but not always. Loosely translated as
“social withdrawal”, it refers to the state of anomie in which an increasing
number of young Japanese seem to fall into. These people typically refuse to go
to school (Jap. 不登校), lock themselves in their bedrooms, and refuse outside
contact with society. This group is currently being scapegoated for a variety of
social issues from school stabbings, and general violence.</p>
<h2 id="the-victims">The Victims</h2>
<p>Otaku can appear to be anyone, they could be your standard citizen, however with
a few peculiarities. To be an otaku means much more than to have an extreme
obsession or passion. Weather his/her specific knowledge pertains to a
particular field, such an anime, manga, networking computers, realistic military
models, or even daytime soap opera; or a more specific field such as a long-run
Japanese anime series such as “Neon Genesis Evangelion”, or the character traits
of every pokemon monster; all otaku strive for the same thing which is to fully
immerse themselves into every minute detail of their object of obsession.</p>
<p>Although otaku frequently identify themselves with people with the same
obsession, this is merely a superficial connection. Most otaku never actually
meet each other, but instead communicate through the Internet. Otaku acknowledge
the inability or futility to achieve the intimacy of ‘authentic’ human
interaction. They draw a protective barrier around themselves, and use their
obsession as the bricks in the wall. Communication between otaku of the same
obsession at it peak would be chatting, face-lessly over the internet, safe
behind their monitors in their own homes.</p>
<p>Otaku spend their time obsessively memorizing and analyzing facts. If they love
computers, then they will read everything and anything about computers they can
find, from how to install a strange operating system-to designing their own
robots. If they obsess over the latest daytime drama, then they will memorize
the characters lines, and perhaps write stories involving the characters in
different situations. This act in itself is an act of perseverance and
conformity to the education system that he/she was brought up in. Both of these
qualities are seen as having ‘virtue’ in Japanese society, but when brought to
extremes can have serious social implications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the purest imaginable display of the narcissism inherent in Japanese
society. The otaku desires both an idealized union and an impregnable
independence-the classic drives of the narcissist. He seems postmodern and
marginal but is deeply traditional in his rejection of the unfamiliar.
Students in the ancient schools of tea ceremony were like otaku. Every member
had to be a mirror of every other member. The otaku represent rebellion as
parodic conformity.</p>
<figcaption><cite>Smith, 81</cite></figcaption>
</blockquote>
<p>The media have recently jumped on the rash of violent activities of a few otaku
and have made the group into monsters. The rate of teenage violent acts of crime
has not increased dramatically in post-bubble years, however the media now has a
scapegoat to points its finger at. Now whenever a violent crime occurs, the
media jumps to cover the latest details, and point the finger at violent otaku
as the culprits. One such incident was the seventeen-year-old boy who bludgeoned
passengers at a Tokyo subway station with a baseball bat. A very well known
incident was the Kobe murders of a child whose head was placed on the wall of
the schoolyard. The teenage culprit was deemed an otaku. The media jumped on the
case of man who had kidnapped, raped and murdered young girls, and kept them in
his house, which was full of hentai manga, or erotic comics, the media then
labeled this collection as “obvious signs” of an otaku.</p>
<p>Hikikomori are the latest addition to outcast groups in Japanese society. Some
hikikomori are school dropouts whom refuse to subject themselves to Japan’s
educational regime. These children fail to become a part of the in-group of the
school system, in both academics and more importantly with their peers. Bullying
and isolation are usually the major reasons for these people to leave school. A
feeling of individuality can cause them to feel different, and therefore wrong
(Note: The Japanese word Chigaimasu (Jap. 違います) means both <em>to be different</em>
and <em>to be wrong</em>).</p>
<p>Hikikomori can feel that they have failed society, or that society has failed
them. By withdrawing from society and denying its existence, they can
concentrate on themselves by escaping to a fantasy society such as television,
or the internet, a place where nobody can put one under the eyes of scrutiny.</p>
<p>There are an estimated one million hikikomori in Japan today. Hikikomori for
whatever reasons feel isolated and therefore different, this leads them to
remove themselvse from society, and withdraw into themselves. Dropping out of
school is the major step in becoming a hikikomori. Instead of going to school,
most of these children spend all of their time in their bedrooms playing video
games, watching television, and participating in and other forms of
self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>Hikikomori are different from otaku in the way they consume these forms of
media. Otaku devour the media as a form of knowledge and as a way to make
themselves part of a group. Hikikomori on the other hand use this media as a
form of escapism. Television allows them to see the outside world without them
being observed or tested. Video games are a way to interact without personal
attachment, or true human interaction. Many hikikomori will use the Internet to
communicate, a form of communication that involves no direct human contact
whatsoever.</p>
<p>Japanese media and society has recently begun to concern itself with these
children. It is caught in a paradox where it cares about these children, but at
the same time praises devices like the Sony Playstation 2, which contains an
Internet terminal, and a DVD player, both which can be used by a hikikomori to
isolate themselves. These devices allow for entertainment, but at the same time
the ability to conduct commercial transactions online, without stepping out of
the house. It fixes people into their individual space.</p>
<h2 id="the-causes">The Causes</h2>
<p>What causes these people to become they way they do? The Japanese education
system is ideal for a state that means to create people who will work well in
industrialized society, and contribute to the state by being a productive
individual who works towards the common goal of prosperity for the nation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pupils are taught not to think but to accumulate immense piles of disparate
facts that can be repeated on command but cannot be connected. This is not an
accident or a lapse. Rote learning is the child’s next lesson is dependence.
To think is an act of autonomy; to memorize the given is to rely upon
authority.</p>
<figcaption><cite>Smith, 78</cite></figcaption>
</blockquote>
<p>This type of education system, rote learning, is measured by intense
examinations that will judge if you have conformed, as well as if you have
memorized the facts presented to you. The subject will either pass or fail; this
does not judge individual achievement, or critical thinking, but instead to
rewards the most conformist individual with entrance to industrial society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Savage competition and force-fed information without the cultivation of
critical thought go far to explain the character of Japanese graduates. The
system’s demands-years in exam hell, every other student an adversary-produce
not exploring intellects but the narrow, machinelike people we assume the
Japanese to be by nature. Wholly focused on achieving the highest possible
place in the hierarchy, they are unable to form healthy ties with
equals-horizontal relationships. They are indifferent to most public issues
because they are unnaturally inward-looking and (by official design) ignorant
of large patches of their own history. Outside of a few conventional
settings-karaoke bars are one-they display little sense of autonomy.</p>
<figcaption><cite>Smith, 79</cite></figcaption>
</blockquote>
<p>Otaku are the direct result of this type of education system. They are an
extreme example of an authoritarian and militaristic rote learning system gone
horribly wrong, an overextention of the education system. While these people
consciously rebel against the society that has created them, they simultaneously
conform to and exhibit the same tendencies and characteristics that the system
has instilled in them. This paradox has created a people who are extreme
examples of “The perfect Citizen”. One who unquestionably lives, works, and only
thinks about the topic given to him/her. This phenomenon is concrete, as you
would find it increasingly difficult to find an example of otaku outside the
realm of the academic system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that Japan’s educational system produces a dedicated
workforce, and that these “corporate warriors” are the engine behind Japan’s
tremendous industrial strength. Obedience to authority, instilled in people
from the time they are small children, makes Japanese society work very
smoothly, with far less of the social turmoil and violent crime that have
plagued other countries. All this is on the plus side of the balance. But
there is a minus side, which, like so many other modern Japanese problems, has
to do with once-good ideas carried too far.</p>
<figcaption><cite>Kerr, 285</cite></figcaption>
</blockquote>
<p>Hikikomori, on the other hand, also exhibit symptoms rooting from problems
within the education system. These problems are from a different issue entirely.
The Japanese education system is built upon the concept of the individual as a
contributor to the society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Standardized textbooks, uniforms, school rules, marching in lockstep around
the school grounds, bowing in unison-these regimens were able to achieve what
350 years of isolation could not: a triumph over regionalism and
individuality. It was probably Japan’s single most serious modern
maladaptation.</p>
<figcaption><cite>Kerr, 282</cite></figcaption>
</blockquote>
<p>When children start schooling in kindergarten, the teacher assigns the students
into “kumi” or groups. These groups will stay together until graduation; they
play together, eat lunch together and study together. The kumi system builds a
strong basis for an “us” and a “them”.</p>
<p>A popular phrase develops from this group orientation called “nakama hazure” or
to be cut off from the group. The children forge a special bond from their
group, and don’t want to be cut off from the group, or they will feel rejected.</p>
<p>Hikikomori have often been rejected from their kumi, and have chosen either
because of a feeling of failure, or a feeling of rejection, to withdraw. This
kumi system is a major catalyst for the budding hikikomori, and most current
information shows that these children had problems with being accepted into such
groups.</p>
<p>School bullying, or ijime is a major issue contributing to the problem of
hikikomori facing the Japanese education system. Ijime arises from the fact that
accepting your role in a conformist society is one of the major issues growing
up in Japan. Accepting your role as a member of a cohesive group is troubling
for youngsters in the system. Due to the intense pressure to conform from
kindergarten onward, many students resort to ijime. Any sort of difference is a
target for ijime, from a difference in speech, or appearance, even excelling in
a specific course is reason enough. Many times students who excel at a
particular class will perform poorly so as not to stand out. There isn’t much a
student can do against this style of bullying as the one who is bullied is
considered the one to be at fault. Teachers indirectly encourage it, to
emphasize obedience within the group.</p>
<p>Students who have studied abroad are obvious targets of ijime. So different is
their upbringing that their classmates have coined a new word for them;
kikokushijo or “Returnees”. Often times these students have to attend special
schools to be indoctrinated back into Japanese society.</p>
<p>An interesting phenomenon in Japan is the way the class teaches itself, from
after-school study groups, in class help, and self-assigned roles of
class-representative, etc. This also involves some children trying to
unconsciously involve the others into the group. If a child is expressing his or
her own opinion, has her own aspirations, or doesn’t exactly fit into the group,
she or he will be ostracized. With all of these separate issues combined, the
issue of continuing to be an individual becomes increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Hikikomori are the result of the unconscious rebellion against a system that
creates robots. These children do not want to be part of a society that has no
individual thought. Since they have no contact with school, they also loose
sight of education, and complete social maturation. Here they fall in between
the social requirements needed to live in Japan, but also lack the individuality
to become an autonomous person.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Now that the Japanese have a new out-group, the finger of blame can be directed
as the source of an assortment of social problems. Japan is now looking at these
“fringe-groups” as the source of the problems, instead of examining the make up
of society and the educational system as the root of the issue. The media
continues to pounce on every opportunity it gets to portray just how sinister
and deplorable members assigned to this group are.</p>
<p>Until Japanese society begins to examine its own social psychological processes,
it will continue to persist an environment that continually defines its own
identity by reference to out-groups that it creates and reinforces.</p>
