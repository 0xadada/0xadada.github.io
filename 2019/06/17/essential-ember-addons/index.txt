### ember-truth-helpers

ember-truth-helpers is a runtime addon adding a set of useful handlebars
template helpers for additional truth logic, useful in `if` statements:
`eq not-eq not and or xor gt gte lt lte is-array is-empty is-equal`.

### qunit-dom

One of my favorites, qunit-dom is a quality assurance addon that makes for more
elegant test assertions against DOM elements. Given the following rendered Ember
component:

```html
<div class="ember-view">
  <p class="copy">This is great</p>
</div>
