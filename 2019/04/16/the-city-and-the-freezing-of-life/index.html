<p>Gibsons
<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/san-francisco-decline-failed-government-policies/">"San Francisco’s Slow-Motion Suicide"</a>
is worth reading, his take is that San Francisco has become too successful...
inevitable to decline into some expensive backwater due to "the rent is too damn
high".</p>
<p>He paints a compelling vision of the ills of appalling levels of income
inequality, the monoculture of white-male-American tech-workers, and the
metastasis of the city into the "hinterlands of Antioch and Vallejo": the
resulting 3 hour-long commutes: yet all these are (in his argument) the results
of a conservative set of "not in my backyard" zoning laws that haven't kept up
with the living force of the city.</p>
<p>Gibsons most powerful argument was wonderful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The legendary urbanist Jane Jacobs once remarked that new ideas come from
old buildings, the types of places you can alter without permission because
no one cares about them. This is one reason why so many garage startups and
garage bands and artists spilling paint in discarded warehouse lofts have
left their mark on the world. The true creative class can’t afford to
rent expensive new studios.”</p>

<p>Gibson alludes to the conservative zoning laws and wealthy property owners
exacerbating the plight of San Francisco and similar cities: Owners want
property values to rise above all other concerns. The problem in San Francisco
isn't a lack of development, but the opposite: The lack of LIFE itself. San
Francisco has privileged the physical static object of the real-estate-object
over the use of space in time. The people owning property and businesses
privilege the real estate value over use value, and the result is a static dead
space where object-value dominates and eliminates the use of space for daily
life.</p>
<p>Recently <a href="https://twitter.com/b_apothecary">a friend of mine</a> packed his
motorcycle up with his distillation laboratory, plastic molding equipment,
machine shop tools, his immense library, his formidable liquor collection, and
moved down to Philadelphia, where he can have a far larger living space,
workspaces are abundantly available, and where the barrier to start new
businesses and develop existing vacant lots for new uses are minimal or
non-existent.</p>

    It is as obliterating as it is banal because
    it does not modify or build from an existing architectural tradition of an area,
    but rather changes it completely. It subtly shifts collective perceptions of
    formerly "working class" areas to abide by the homogenizing effects of global
    capitalism and disconnects the area from the social histories in which it
    exists.

<p>The drive to urbanization is an imperative of capitalism, this drive results in
<q>a freezing of life</q>— a static world devoid of spontaneity, the result of land
development and bureaucratic zoning laws optimized for rent seeking and
increased land valuations, devoid of nature and where its residents have no
ability to change their surroundings to suit daily life. All desire for change
is eliminated in order to serve the profit generating imperative of capital, all
autonomy of local residential use is therefore foreclosed, instead privileging
real estate development as the only legitimate use.</p>
<p>The result of this is a predominance of land organized around the valuable
placement of real estate objects over the living use and alteration of land by
the very people who live in these spaces, people who wish to change their
surroundings over time as use-patterns and ways of living change with the
seasons and with time. The philosopher Hegel explored this concept saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Space is the connection of the quiescent asunderness and side-by-sideness of
things [objects]; Time is the connection of their vanishing or alteration...
In the spatial world the question is not succession but of coexistence... As a
restless Becoming [Time] is not an element of the synthetic whole.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is to say: the privileging of objects in space fetishizes the object and
therefore sacrifices changes in time. This creates an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentrified_architecture">alienated and static space of purely fetishized structures</a>,
devoid of life.</p>
