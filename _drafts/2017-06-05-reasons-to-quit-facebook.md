TL;DR: Facebook commodifies our relationships, reifies them, and sells them back
to us. These stories are about the asymmetric power that Facebook has over us 
when we continually give them private information about ourselves and our friends.
Facebook uses this information to commodify and target us for advertising, which
ultimately is used to change our very behaviors.
