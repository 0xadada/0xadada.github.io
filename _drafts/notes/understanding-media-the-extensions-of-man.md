> Whereas pleasure is a counter-irritant (sports, entertainment, alcohol), comfort is the removal of irritants. <cite>pp43</cite>
Our central nervous system seek pleasure and to negate pain, but removal of plain allows us to stop the need to seek pleasure. This is when one achieves "contentment".

> As we relate more and more with technology (extensions of our central nervous system) we need to decrease our perceptual stimulation to prevent ourselves from overwhelming the central nervous system. This results in numbness. It fosters apathy and unconsciousness. <cite>pp47</cite>

> In the electric age we will wear all mankind as our skin.<cite>pp47</cite>
That is to say electronic devices have extended our central nervous system to include all people to be percieved in total awaredness as an extension of ourselves. A shift back to a single consciousness-not individuality.

> By means of translation of immediate sense experience into vocal symbols the entire world can be invoked and retrieved at any instant.<cite>pp57</cite>
> The very way humans are able to translate thought and experience-through words, text and electronic media means we externalize our memory - and therefore our media becomes an extension of our memory/body - like a hammer becomes an extension of our hand.<cite>pp59</cite>

The novelty of human language was that it enabled humans to encode sensory experiences into sounds (language) that would be "understood" or even "re-lived" by other humans. This allows humans to experience more experiences than a single life would allow. The act of speech both transmits, duplicates and externalizes memory. Electronic media will provide a similar paradigm shift by encoding sensory experiences in images, video, 3D, and real-time internet connections that will open the door to humans experiencing real and imaginary sensory exerpeiences never before possible.

> The printed word is simply "Trapped" speech waiting to be re-released as words spoken.<cite>pp81</cite>

Speech and language separate men because of an inability to understand one-another in as much as it helps speakers of the same language to communicate thought. Computers promise to skip the translation of language in a way that simply skips translation inead by encoding pure thought and experience between individuals, ushering in a new era of collective consciousness and understanding.<cite>pp80</cite>

> This is the new world of the "Global Village".<cite>pp93</cite>
Just as paper and roads enabled Rome to centralize government and focus resources to the city from the country, electronic media allows a shift back to margins.

In capitalism, where everyone is a producer of consumer, we used Empire to force the third world to become permanent consumers of our production via "charity". By forcing them into dependant-consumption we turn them into slaves.

Technology strongly encourages specialization in increasing amounts as well as fragmentation and therefore multiplication of perspectives and therefore isolation (fragmentation) amongst people in society. Technology extends our sense of perception: touch unifies them as the "common sense". <cite>pp108</cite>

Privacy isn't visible actions behind closed doors, but our innermost thoughts. Those are what really require the protection of privacy controls. <cite>pp119</cite>

> From coin to paper currency, and from currency to credit card there is a steady progression towards commercial exchange as the movement of information itself. <cite>pp137</cite>

McLuhan suggests an information economy with knowledge workers function in a "workless" society of "information hunter-gatherers".
> The age of instant information man ends his job of fragmented specialization and assumes the role of information gathering. Today the information-gathering resumes the inclusive concept of "culture" exactly as the primitive food-gatherer worked in complete equilibrium with his entire environment. Our quarry now, in this new nomadic and "workless" world is knowledge and insight into the the creative process of life and society. <cite>pp138</cite>

> ... work meant specialist servatude, and leisure alone meant a life of human dignity and involvement of the whole man. <cite>pp161</cite>
Specialization is the result of servitude, a slave specializes to prove his worth to his master. Specialized work removes man from unfocused wholistic fulfillment ane search for dignity - that is left for him to discover in his own leisure time.

> Travel differs very little from going to a movie or turning the pages of a magazine. People never really leave the beaten path of impercipience, nor do they ever arrive at any new place.

Hollywood profits by selling dreams of superabundance and wealth to the poor. A movie is a commodity, a prefabricated "canned dream", the very act of dreaming, without having to conjur the dream themselves.
