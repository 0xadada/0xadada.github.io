# No Place to Hide
## Edward Snowden the NSA and the US Surveilence State

Glenn Greenwald

Post 9/11 veneration of security above all else has created a climate conducive to abuses of power.

The US revolution was fueled by opposition to general searches of colonialists homes. The Fourth Ammendment enshrines this idea in clear and succinct law:

> "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable search and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particuarly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."

to abolish generalized, suspicionless surveillence.

History shows examples of the mere existance of mass surveillance is sufficient to stiffle dissent. A citizenry aware of always being watched quickly becomes complacient and fearful.

The aim is to surpress dissent and mandating total compliance.

The ability to evesdrop on everyones communication - all the time vests immense power and responsibility to those with that power. Unless that power is held in check with rigorous oversight and accountability, it is almost certain to be abused. Expecting it not be be abused runs counter to every example of human nature.

As more of our private lives move onto or involve the internet, this entails more encroachments of the state examining and analysing our lives. To permit surveillance of the internet is to subject more and more form of human interaction to scrutiny. Eventually all discussions, planning, and even (eventually) thought itself will be succeptible to state examination. 

The potential of the internet is its ability to level the plaing field between the powerless and the powerful. Internet freedom is using it without institutional constraints, social or state control  and pervasive fear, aloowing surveillance will gut this potential, and turn it into a tool for oppressive control.

We stand at a crossroads where we can use internet to usher in an age of individual liberty and political freedom; or a system of omnipresent monitoring and control.

The only way the powerful may enjoy privacy is through the same means as the ordinary, one enforced by the laws of nature, rather than by the policies of man.

Snowdens missive to journalists:

> My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them. The US Government, in consipiracy with client states, chiefest among them the Five Eyes - UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - have inflicted upon the world a system of secret pervasive surveilance from which there is no refuge. They protect their domestic systems from the overight of citizenry through classification and lies, and sheild themselves from outrage in the event of a leak by overemphasizing limited protections they choose to grant the governed...
> The enclosed documents are real and original, and are offered to provide an understanding how the global, passive surveillance system works so that protections against it may be developed. On the day of this writing, all new communications records that can be ingested and cataloged by this system are intended to be held for [] years, and the new "massive data repositories" (euphemistacally "mission" data repositories) are being built and deployed worldwide, and the largest is the new data center in Utah, while I pray that public awareness will lead to debate will lead  to reform, bear in mind that the policies of men change in time, and even the Constitution is subverted when the appetite for power demand it. In words from history: Let us speak no more in faith in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of cryptography. <cite>Edward Snowden</cite>

FISA: Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act created in 1978 after Church Committee discovered decades of abusive government surveillance. All FISA court decisions are TOP SECRET.
  All Verizon international and domestic call logs are turned over to NSA, section 215 of the PATRIOT ACT authorizes this: "Business records no longer need probable cause for request, merely "relevance" to any investivation: pending or ongoing.
  Democratic Senators Mark Udall (D:colorado) and Ron Wyden (D:Oregon) members of the Senate Intelligence Committee know of the secret interpretation of the Section 215 and are granted immunity by the constitution to disclose information but have not yet done so.

BOUNDLESS INFORMANT: NSA logs of American phones * email correspondence. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lied under oath to Congress while this logging was occurring. These documents prcicely lay-out the precise number of intercepted comms despite what was testified to in Congress. March 12, 2013.

US Gov
# Refuses oversight
# Refuses accountability when crimes are proven committed
# Grants retroactive immunity to clear themselves of crimes posto-facto

Leadership is about acting first and serving us an example to others, not waiting for others to act:
> "The true measure of a persons worth isn't what they say they believe in, but what they do in defense of those beliefs." <cite>Edward Snowden</cite>
> "If you are not acting on those beliefs, they are probably not real" <cite>Edward Snowden</cite>

[the internet] "a place unto itself that offered freedom, exploration, and the potential for intellectual growth and understanding" a space for experimentation where mistakes wont follow us because its private and anonymous.

"... NSA was building a system whos goal was the elimination of privacy, globally. To make it so that no one could communicate electronically, without the NSA being able to collect, store and analyze the communication."

US Media uses a "middle-of-the-road" approach where it gives equal creedence to US Gov claims even when they're frivilous, anonymous or false/decitful. This approach is what prevented newspapers from using the word "torture" to dscribe CIA methods in Guantanamo Bay when used by US media to describe CIA methods is called "enhanced interrogation techniques" while describing the same techniques in a foreign government as "torture".

The defacto rules (Government always gets the right of first edit) in place allows the government to control and neuter the news gathering process and eliminate the adversarial relationship between the press and government.

### The Power of Metadata

An example of the power of Meta Data:

* Woman receives call from a family practictioner or gynecologist
* Woman makes call to mother
* Woman makes call to a male she frequently only speaks to after 8pm
* Next morning woman calls a family planning / Planned Parenthood clinic

These facts are more powerful than the content of the conversations themselves.

XKEYSCORE: Logs of web browsing history with a history of which sites were visited by browsers and when visited. Emails sent and to whom they were sent. Chat logs and audio/video conferencing records.

> "When the United States is able to know everything that everyone is doing, saying, thinking, and planning- its' own citizens, foreign populations, international corporations, other government leaders- its' power over those factions are marginalized. Thats doubly true if the government operates at ever greater levels of secrecy. The secrecy creates a one-way mirror: The government sees what everyone else in the world does, including its' own population, which noone sees its' own actions. It is the ultimate imbalance permitting the most dangerous of all human conditions: The excercise of limitless power with no transparency or accountability." <cite>Glenn Greenwald</cite>

This is a grave threat to democratic governance; where its democratic nation can be subverted at every step.

If you have nothing to hide, why do you have passwords on your phone, email, and social media? Lets ask a simple question: "How much do you make per year?" Saying you have nothing to hide is never true.

If you believe you are always being watched or judged, you cannot really act freely. This goes for both state, corporate and religous authority. Christian parents have long used Santa claus as an omnipresent witness to ensure compliant behavior.

More effective than a police force, the deprevation of privacy will crush any temptation to deviate from rules and norms imposed by spiritual, state, societal, corporate, or familial values.

The private realm is where we can challenge and innovate rules and norms imposed by others. Without this realm, we lose the ability to improve society beyond the existing status quo.
The danger of ubiquitus surveillance is not that every piece of information is being read, but from how people change their behaviors because they are susceptible to monitoring. This change of behavior serves the interests of those in power.

David Miranda was detained at UK Heathrow Airport under an anti-terrorism statue due to his association with Glenn Greenwald. They argued his surveillance reporting as terrorism on the grounds that it "is designed to influence a government and is made for the purposes of promoting a political or ideological cause. It therefore falls within the definition of terrorism."

> "But the true measure of a societies freedom is how it treats its' dissidents and other marginalized groups, not how it treats its loyalists." <cite>Glenn Greenwald</cite>

> "We shouldn't have to be faithful loyalists of the powerful to feel safe from state surveillance." <cite>Glenn Greenwald</cite>

NSA spying is justified w/ "Terrorism" but then used to tap the phone lines of Angela Merkel, and private UN meetings. This shows an abuse of power and a misconstruing of the rationale behind surveillance. Equally, the surveillance of Brazillian political leaders, Brazil Petrobas, and even General Petreus should have nothing to do with Terrorism.
NSA has never provided any evidence of a single instance of uqiquitus surveillance helping to stop terrorism to the Senata Intelligence Committee, as requested by Senators Udall & Wyden.
* Boston wasn't prevented
* Christmas day underwear bomber
* NYC Times Square plot
* NYC subway bomb
* NYC Chelsea bombing and NYC subway were all handled by traditional gumshoe detective work and policing.

The cost spent fighting terrorism needs to be proportionate to the size of the threat. We dismantle core internet security and quickly sacrifice privacy to protect against a threat smaller than the danger of drowning in the bathtub.
Cost increase since 2001 in terrorism expenditures is roughly 1,000,000,000,000 while the rist of dying in a terrorist attack is 1:3,500,000. 

Persuing absolute physical security is not our only societal priority. So too is convienience, freedom, and privacy.
Privacy enables other qualities of life:
* Creativity
* Exploration
* Intimacy

Noone wishes to sacrifice everything for absolute safety.

In a healthy democracy, accountability is required along with consent of the governed. This is only possible if the governed are aware of what is being done in their name.

> "Transparency is for those who carry out public duties and exercise public powers. Privacy is for everyone else." <cite>Glenn Greenwald</cite>

Both obedience to authority and dissent are moral choices, authorities typically have rewards in place for those being obedient and punishments for those dissenting.
