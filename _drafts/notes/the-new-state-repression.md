A governments aim is to maintain the alleigance of its population.

Using naked supression of a non-violent civil disobedience, the holders of power can separate the insurgent leaders from itss followers by saying it will make consessions once the disobedience stops. In return, they will stop the surpression of convienience and rights. This creates a rift that segments the insurgent group into those who follow the insurgent leaders and those who wish to stop disobedience so the concessions can commence. Rarely do concessions commence, but nearly always does the group fragement and splinter.

Conclusions:
1. Don't assume that governments attitude towards protest is or always will be to tolerate them.
1. Don't assume that constitutional or legal protections of our rights are enough to protect our movements. Power has the ability to selectively enforce laws to serve its own interests.
1. We must always publicly disclose our objective basis for insurgency.
1. We must see insurgency as a permanent state of struggle against all forms of power and oppression (Power always returns when the Revolution ends, thus it must not end).
