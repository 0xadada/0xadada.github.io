Privacy is control over intimate facts about ourselves.

Landmark case: "Warren & Brandeis": The Right to be Left Alone.

Edward Coke: "A mans house is his castle"

The *belief* one is being observed is a grievance about privacy - it causes us to change our behaviors, even if we are not actually being watched.

Surveilance results in mistrust of authority and suspicion both of their surveilance and the subject of surveilance.

Denmark requires a license/permit to allow video surveilance. France, Germany require signs placed to indicate when one is under surveilance.

Ideally, biometrics are immutable over time.

Surfing behavior as a way to misrepresent identity (This person surfs violent porn, therefore (misleadingly) they themselves must participate in violent sexual acts).

Personal behavior assembled from multiple sources to create a comprehensive lifestyle profile.

Anonimity by using N-jump trusted intermediaries; You->Trusted party -> Nth Trusted intermediary -> Destination (transitive trusted 3rd party)

US Supreme court holds the First Ammendment protects the right to anonymous speech

Reasons for Privacy
* Anonimity for whistleblowers / dissidents
* Protection from abuse
* Privacy in a private domain free from government encroachment
* Privides a space free of domination from others
* Provides a space free of a concieved social mask or identity
* Provides a space for testing new creative moral activities and ideas
* Provides a space for sharing intimate moments and limited and protected communication

Privacy is the right to be left alone, unconstrained and uninhibited by others

Privacy is the basic right to self-determine the demarcation point of what is public and what is private domain.

Privacy is the extent to which an individual has control over information about themself.
* The right to exhert that control
* A power to disclose or keep private
* Privacy is lost when control is lost

Disclosure of private information results in the *potential* loss of privacy. In the case is then dissemenated outside ones control, privacy is lost.

Supreme Court (1928) Olmstead vs United States, Katz (1967) established privacy as the right to be left alone:

> to protect that right, every unjustifable intrusion by the government upon the privacy of the individual, whatever means employed, must be deemed a violation of the Fourth Ammendment."

> "Reasonable expectation of privacy" holds for both individuals against individuals as well as police and government. The expectation standards are the same <cite>pp 94</cite>

Privacy is not a hampering of law enforcement, but a right of our people need, whos value is greater than increased police efficiency.

> Freedom of expression is a social good because it is the best process by which to advance knowledge and discover truth, starting from the premise that the soundest and rational judgement is carried out when all facts are considered, both for and against. <cite>pp 112</cite>

Free speech performs an essential function in promotion and maintenence of democratic self-government.

Free speech is justified by the "assumption of infallability" that specifies the confidence we have in believing what we think is true, is actually true. This confidence is arrived at by allowing individuals to debate ideas. Interference with this debate diminishes our ability to arrive at rational belief systems.


## Informational Self-Determination

> Data relating to and individual should not be collected in the absense of a genuine purpose, and the consent of the individual concerned.<cite>Council of Europe 1981 Convention for the Protection of Individuals</cite>

Funcional Non-Identifiability: Not absolute pure anonimity to allow for the benefits of a hidden identity but let the identity be revealed by law-enforcement.

Lessig argues the internet can be a place where freedom prevails or one of oppressive control. How this is determined is produced by code itself.

The ideal (read: right) solution to privacy protection is explicit, carefully drafted legislation that creates civil and criminal sanctions for serious offensive, intentional, or reckles intrusion into an individuals solitude or seclusion and the unauthorized publishing of personal information, balanced against free speech.
