### Calculative Thinking vs Meditative Thinking

> The production of new, ever-promising, focused, task-orinted thinking versus the contemplative, wholistic thinking that considers everything.
> Modernity values the productivity and economic value in calculative thinking and sees contemplative as valueless.

> Mac Orlan underscored the importance of adventure in the mind, of the adventure we find in reverie, in meditative thinking in apparently useless daydream. He isn't fond of high-tech adventures. Too explosive, he says, too chemical, too noisy; they can't retain peoples interests too long. Participants have to keep moving along, to hear louder bangs, do riskier jumps, from greater heights, make even-more hazardous expeditions, up peaks, across deserts, through treacherous jungles, over virgin lands, you name it. It's all distraction, all leisure. Getting away from everything, forgetting at-best for a day, maybe for a week. A vacation if you're lucky. <cite>pp165 L12068</cite>

### Finding Happiness

> The path of the straight and narrow is a lie, it's the path to someone elses happiness. The path of true happiness is difficult but with surprising twists and turns. The true path is through honesty.<cite>pp8 L1043<cite>

> So often, people let themselves be lead down the paths against their better interests, cajoled somehow, seduced into doing stuff, following because everybody else follows, does likewise, takes that path. It's usually easier to be lead and to follow them to take a different route, to stand your ground stubbornly, and go where you want to go. 

### The Wrong Path

The Paradox of "Buridens Ass": A donkey placed between two piles of hay will starve due to its' indecision. A good man a moral decision to best serve the greater good will waste his life trying to determine all outcomes equally.

Politics, mathematics, technology, and science are not a lifestyle: These are just tools that get in the way of real life, that is to say Love, Art and Devotion.

### Travel

> "I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. The great affair is to move; to feel the needs and hitches of our life more nearly; to come down off this feather-bed of civilization, and find the globe granite underfoot and stream with cutting flints."
> <cite>pp152 L 1911: -Robert Louis Stevenson</cite>

### Non-Violence

> I've never seen a donkeys tail kill a single fly. The tail is more a deterrent, a hairy peacekeeping force. <cite>pp156 L1960</cite>

### Against the Elites

> The rich mans folly passes for good judgement in our world. <cite>p221 L 2767</cite>
