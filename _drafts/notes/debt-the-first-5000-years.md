IMF loans specify democratic elections must take place, but the elected leaders have no power to change the policies mandated by the IMF loans.

Empire: Countries with military bases located outside its borders.

In gift economies, gifts exchanged never have equal value. To exchange gifts of equal value would be to cancel all debts between people and therefore cancel the need for social and moral obligation to one another. <cite>pp111</cite>

You can judge how egalitarian a society is by wether those in positions of authority are merely conduits for the redistribution of wealth or use their authority to accumulate wealth. <cite>pp113</cite>

Slavery is most-possible when humans are forcibly stripped of their context: <cite>pp158</cite>

  * Location and thus to the land
  * Social obligations and relationships
  * Language and ability to communicate
  * An impossible debt is levied against them so their plight is justified

In effect, their humanity is removed and their individual uniqueness is removed so they can be compared quantitatively with a numeric value; then they can easily be sold into slavery as a commodity.

The most common denominator across all types of slavery is that the slave would have likely died had they not become a slave:

  * Criminals of a capital crime
  * Poverty
  * Prisoner of war
  * Kidnapping
  * Debt

Rights as obligations: My right to a trial by my peers is my obligation to do jury duty. <cite>pp207</cite>

> Early Islam saw money as a third-party comparator to evaluate equality between two items for trade. As-such, money was a means to an end, not an end in itself. Usuary is dealing with money as an end in-itself, and as-such seen as amoral. Early Islam also prohibited government interference with fixed prices or market interference. The rules of the market were dictated by God (The Invisible Hand?) <cite>pp277</cite>

Interesse: Compensation for the loss suffered because of late payment. Interest is a monthly rent paid to the creditor for the potential money lost having invested that money elsewhere.

Corporate Amorality: Executives are morally and legally bound to ignore moral considerations because they are merely employees whos sole responsibility is to provide maximum returns to the corporate shareholders: <cite>pp320</cite>
  * Shareholders aren't given any moral input on decision-making
  * Most executives are in-fact shareholders

> "Politics is the dimension of social life in which things do become true if enough people believe in them." <cite>pp342</cite>

Seigniorage: Low interest rates and an inflation rate that is higher than the interest rate will mean the purchasing power of that money is worth less after a year. Seigniorage is the value of that difference.
