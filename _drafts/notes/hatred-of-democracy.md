Democracy: "Government of the multitude"

The US constitution is a classic example of composing forces and of balancing institutional mechanisms intended to get the most out of the fact of democracy, all the while strictly containing it in order to protect "a government of the best; and preservation of the order of property"

Marx: The law an institutions of formal democracy are appearances under which; and instruments by which the burgoise are able to exercise power. The struggle against these appearances is the path to "real" democracy: where liberty and equality wouldn't be represented in law and institutions but in concrete life and daily experience.

Thesis of anti-democratic sentiment (in the US):
Democracy is bad when it allows itself to be corrupted by democratic society: which wants everyone to be equals and all diferences respected. Democracy is good however, whien it rallies the weak to war to defend the values of civilization, and the values pertaining to the clash of civilization that separate people.

Forms of democratic life that affirm the power of the people:
  * Undermining the principals of good government
  * No respect for public authorities
  * No acknowledgement for experts or specialists
  * No acknowledgement for pragmatists

Selection or "Election" of the Democratic leader by drawing of lots emphasizes the equality of all members of society. It doesn't matter who is in charge; <cite>pp42</cite>
  * We are all able
  * We are all in charge
There is one category to exclude from the list of those who are capable of governing, it is in any case those who set their sights on obtaining power." <cite>pp43</cite>

> "Democracy is not a type of constitution, nor form of society. The power of the people is not that of people gathered together, of the majority, or of the working class. It is simply the power particular to those who have no more entitlements to govern than to submit." <cite>pp46</cite>

> "Politics is the foundation of a power to govern in the absense of a foundation" <cite>pp49</cite>
1. Government is only legitimate when it is political
1. It is political only when it rests on an absense of foundation (based on egalitarian equaliberte)
1. This is what "Democracy" means when accurately understood of as a "Law of Chance" (i.e. Anyone and everyone can govern, it doesn't matter because we are all equals)
Democracy is not the society to be governed nor the government of society; but the state of ungovernable that government is based.

A formalized government always tries to make the affairs of governance a private affair, which results in a shrinkage of the sphere of "public life", reducing the points of public intervention in governance. Democracy is the struggle of increasing the sphere of public affairs in governance to all participants. <cite>pp55</cite>

The goal of Democracy is to reaffirm everyones place in public life and to place limits of the control of wealth that aims to increase the number of participants relegated to merely private life. <cite>pp58</cite>

> "... the logics of birth and wealth produce elites with 'capabilities' who have the time and means to enlighten themselves and impose republican standards on democratic anarchy." <cite>pp65</cite>

> "The school, by means of which the state distributes the elements to educate simultaneously both men and citizens, quite naturally suggest itself as the best institution for realizing that idea." <cite>pp68</cite>

Minimal conditions under which a representative democracy can be declared democratic: <cite>pp72</cite>
  1. Short and non-renewable electoral mandates that cannot be held concurrently
  1. A monopoly of peoples representatives over the formulation of new lawas
  1. A ban on state functionaries becoming representitives of the people
  1. a bare minimum on campaigns and campaign costs
  1. Monitoring of possible interference by economic powers in the electoral process

A vote legitimizes the Oligarchy as those best suited to solve societal problems and signals consent to be governed by the Oligarchy. To abstain is to protest both legitimacy as well as to refuse to acknowledge their ability to solve the problems. <cite>pp73</cite>

The natural compulsion of oligarchic government is to get rid of [The People] and politics. State and regional leaders simply say they're adminstering the local consequences of a global necessity. Supra-state institutions which are not accountable to people begin to de-politicize political matters, by shifting the debate to places that leave no space for democratic intervention - where the State and Technocratic experts can quietly agree amongst themselves. <cite>pp81</cite>

With the fall of the Soviet Union, Capitalism list its designated enemy, as well as an alternative possible vision of the future. <cite>pp92</cite>

> "The government of 'anyone and everyone' will attract hatred by those who feel entitled to govern by birth, wealth or science." <cite>pp94</cite>

> "Democracy is the actions that wrests the monopoly of Public Life from oligarchic governments, and the omnipotence over lives by the power of wealth - a general struggle against the power of domination." <cite>pp96</cite>
> "Democracy exists and only remains constant with consistant and continual acts of struggle against Domination. This fact inspires courage and joy in its simplicity - and hope." <cite>pp97</cite>
