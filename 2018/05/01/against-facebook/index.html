<p><em>Alarm goes off, time to wake up. Snooze alarm, and then repeat: check email,
check Facebook, check Twitter, check Snapchat, rinse; repeat again; no new
posts? Check again. No second spared to compose a thought; dreams fade away. Day
continues just the same way — rise, rinse, repeat, repeat. Can't spare time to
sit and relax, can't let your mind wander not five minutes, no unstructured
thought or daydream; just repeat. Every moment captures value — must increase
engagement! must repeat! —no time for grander narratives, to solve for bigger
problems. Atomize attention into smaller slice of microwork, then catch up,
read, listen, swipe right, repeat, like, pull-to-refresh, to scroll to infinity,
and then again. No matter if you’re pulling espresso shots, serving tables, or
playing with computers all day: they all end the same: Netflix &#x26; chill, the
guardian of sleep, TV, our collective lullaby. Wake up with screens, go to bed
with screens. We no longer shit alone. The death of idleness.</em></p>
<p>This essay explores the ways Facebook transforms our attention into a product,
and how that transformation changes us. It then proposes a social media strike
as a concrete strategy to reclaim our attention, and finally lists many reasons
why we should all quit Facebook.</p>
<h2>The Commodification of Microwork</h2>
<p>Social media companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Snapchat have created
a marketplace for our attention, where we become the product sold to advertisers
who subtly change our behavior to buy products and services for their own
benefit. This type of persuasion is most effective when these platforms command
our attention with a heightened level of distraction. We create the content that
is then used to command the attention of our peers, which is then used to sell
advertising space while the surrounding content is measured for engagement, and
the results are analyzed to optimize the next round of ad placement. This
process is the commodification of microwork— the seemingly small tasks that we
are compelled to do by force of habit, tasks that aren't in our own interests
but in the interests of the platforms and advertisers using our attention and
time to pad their bottom lines. Also known as “heteromation” (Ekbia, Nardi,
2014), microwork includes reading timelines, posting photos &#x26; updates, liking,
retweeting, and generally dedicating our time, attention, and emotions to these
platforms—each tiny action its own form of labor, given over freely to the
advertisers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The new media of surveillance capitalism solicit social behaviors, monitor
those behaviors, map social interactions, and resell what they learn to
advertisers and others.” <cite>(Turner, 2017)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Platforms like Facebook are attempting to create systems for the generation of
distraction, Crary describes it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“conditions that individuate, immobilize, and separate subjects, even within a
world in which mobility and circulation are ubiquitous. In this way attention
becomes key to the operation of noncoercive forms of power” <cite>(Crary,
2001, pg. 74)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over time, these systems continually push our attention and distraction to new
limits and thresholds. Youtube &#x26; Netflix discovers that auto-playing the next
related video dramatically increases views (Bridle, 2017); Twitter uses the
"pull-to-refresh" UI gesture that leverages variable rewards to trigger
addictive behavior as a way to increase user engagement with the timeline;
Facebook uses the “red dot” notifications that keep people checking their phone
for the next new thing. These gadgets are designed to create a “supernormal
stimulus,” that is, a stimulus that produces a stronger than natural response.
We can even internalize the supernormal stimulus—an example is the "phantom
vibrate" we sometimes feel in our pocket when no vibration occurs. In the case
of social media, the supernormal stimulus is used to exploit our response to
novelty in order to elicit a behavior that works in the interests of the social
media provider.</p>
<p>This eventually leads to a crisis of attentiveness, where the system must
maintain an increased level of distraction. In order to continually distract us,
the visual landscape must constantly change, requiring us to reorient our
attention until the shift from one thing to another becomes the natural state
(e.g. the Instagram “Explore” tab). Over time, we begin to value our attention
while the platforms struggle to get more and more of what they previously got
for free. This is not sustainable, as newer products need to continually
revolutionize the means of distraction or else we will realize how distracted we
really are. With a loss of distraction, we can more easily achieve self
actualization.</p>
<p>This process of commodification has turned us all into tastemakers, reviewers,
likers, retweeters and brand ambassadors. The platform takes our real authentic
friendships and first commodifies them,
<a class="Annotation-ref" href="#anno:1">reifies them</a>,
<span class="Annotation" id="anno:1">Reification happens when something is taken
away from a thinking subject, displaced into an object, and turned against the
subject.</span> and then sells them back to us as an “image of friendship”, but
one that is bankrupt of any genuine social value. Over time, these platforms
transform us all into unpaid advertising agencies. We promote goods, services,
lifestyles and desires to our friends, weaponizing images to generate feelings
of jealousy and FOMO amongst our peers during those idle moments when they feel
most bored. These idle moments are when we are most vulnerable, and thus we’re
psychologically primed to accept the supernormal stimulus. The platform
capitalizes on this vulnerability, and over time begins to redefine what we once
considered “real” friendship into a relationship with the platform itself,
mediated by the features and “images of friendship” within it through Liked and
Retweeted posts, Snapchat streaks, Follow requests, posted text, images or even
how we reduce our emotions into a series of emoji (Smith, 2016).</p>

  <figcaption>The process of commodification</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this way, the platform is able to monetize our friendships, tastes, opinions,
and even our emotions. Our internal thoughts and experiences become
commodifiable assets, measured as engagements to be analyzed, A-B tested,
optimized and charted, then touted by executives in PowerPoint presentations at
board meetings. Our experiences are mined, packaged, and sold, and we are not
paid a dime.</p>
<p>Instead of blindly activating our social media habit for that quick dopamine
fix, consider who actually benefits. Are you performing a microwork task for
Facebook or Snapchat? If so, then why aren't you being paid?</p>

<p>Newspapers, cable news, and social media platforms are trying to turn us all
into media addicts. These businesses rely on persuading us to consume more and
more (keyword: “increase engagement”) in order to curate an “interest in current
affairs” (e.g. New York Times) or to “build meaningful and connected
relationships with our community” (e.g. Facebook.)</p>
<p>The reality of the media, however, is driven by a simple business rule: Sell
what sells best, the supernormal stimuli: whether it’s clickbait, memes, curated
lifestyles, celebrity gossip, salacious headlines, and freak events. The media
tends to focus on the rare incidents that have no actual influence on our daily
lives, and the goal of these platforms is to keep us addicted. Facebook’s 2017
Annual Report makes it clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their
engagement and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on
News Feed, partially offset by increasing user engagement with video content
and other product changes. <cite>(Facebook, 2017)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think we’re immune to the persuasiveness of advertising, but remember,
advertising is a $600 billion dollar industry that is the financial basis of
the tech sector. The massive profits these companies have built have been done
so on the backs of advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>Facebook’s (and Google’s, etc.) real agenda is to display and sell ads—not to
help people “build meaningful and connected relationships.” At no point was this
more clear than during Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony before Congress. When Senator
Hatch asked him, “How do you sustain a business model in which people don’t pay
for your service?” his response was as straightforward as it could’ve been:
“Senator, we run ads.” (NBC News, 2018).</p>

 <figcaption>Senator, we run ads.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>“Building Relationships” is the rationale used in order to serve the
advertisements, but the advertisements themselves are the real content of these
platforms. The business arrangement of the platform is a simple one: ads are the
content, the advertisers are the clients, the user doing microwork tasks are the
workers, and <em>our future behaviors are the product</em>.</p>
<p>As a result, we end up building relationships to the platform—not to each other.</p>
<p>Through the investment of our attention, we allow the commodities and ideologies
of the platform to bombard our unconscious and subtly shape our behavior. The
process of "exchanging time for image, provides the counterflow to the moving
image and as advertising revenues would indicate, is itself productive of
value." (Beller 2006, p.79)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Facebook’s nearly one billion users have become the largest unpaid workforce
in history" <cite>(Laney, 2012)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The intended effect the media wishes to create is media-driven neuroticism—a
love of change for its own sake, or neomania, a love of new things. Ultimately,
neomania together with the media has a negative effect on our moods, which isn’t
surprising considering most of what makes the daily news is negative. This
leaves us feeling powerless, like the world is falling apart. So we turn to
social media to witness the (seemingly) beautiful lives of celebrities, and the
romantic and exciting lives of our friends and family. But this ends up driving
the compulsion to compare our own lives with those of the people we see on
social media, creating feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, and jealousy. These
feelings are misguided however, since the lives we see in the media and social
platforms are a tightly edited and curated spectacle of people presenting an
<em>image of how they want to appear, not of how they actually are.</em></p>
<h2>Practical Defense Against Unpaid Microwork</h2>

<p>Today it's popular to hear about the media detox or a social media diet. The
concept is often framed as a metaphor for eating and weight loss. We can extend
this metaphor to consider the microwork tasks we find ourselves doing on a daily
basis. Are the habits and media and we consume daily like the healthy foods that
we can use to build a healthy mind and body? Or will they ultimately poison us?
To live a healthy life we should moderate our media consumption the same way we
do with the things we eat.</p>
<p>The toxicity of the media can be understood as a signal-to-noise problem. The
more media we consume, the more noise we get (rather than the valuable part,
called the signal.) If we consume the news on a yearly basis (in the form of
books), we can assume about half of what we consume is signal, and the rest
noise (randomness). If we increase our frequency to a daily intake, the
composition would increase to about 95% noise, and only 5% signal. If we
increase our intake to an hourly frequency (as those who follow the stock market
or heavy social media users do) the composition increases to 99.5% noise and
0.5% signal. This is roughly 200% more noise than signal, more toxic noise to
both misdirect and distract, and has negative effects on our mood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Distraction could be described as a phenomenon in which you connect,
inadvertently or absentmindedly, to more things than you intended. The noise
drowns out the signal. <cite>(Solnit, 2018)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A practical approach for a healthy relationship with the media we consume is to
create distance between ourselves and the media that surrounds us on a daily
basis. Distance creates an opportunity to gain new perspectives on the media
(and life in general). This distance reduces the influence of these platforms,
and creates a space for our ideas and imagination to flourish.</p>
<p>Idleness and imagination are essential to our wellbeing, they’re the wellspring
of mental clarity, and the backstop for memory. Take a few minutes each day to
cultivate idleness and some mental space. Step away from the hourly, daily,
weekly media cycle, and read books instead. Books benefit from the perspective
of time, which results in more settled and established facts with increased
depth of analysis. If our goal is to have a wider perspective, and a balanced
understanding of the major forces at work in the world, our best bet is to read
<em>good</em> books.</p>
<p>This essay gives us the task of avoiding contact with the mundane, cheap, and
ephemeral media that surrounds us on a daily basis; to avoid having our
attention distracted, redirected, exploited, and abused against our own
interests. We should ignore those things that bring no happiness or value to our
lives. Instead, we should focus our attention on our imagination, quality
thought, friends and family, idleness; on things that matter. We should explore
effective ways to reclaim clarity of thought, and autonomy of attention.</p>
<p>The task is to change the very way we attend the world around us. Henry David
Thoreau described a similar mental recalibration in <em>Life Without Principle</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we have thus desecrated ourselves, — as who has not? — the remedy will be
by wariness and devotion to reconsecrate ourselves, and make once more a fane
of the mind. <em>We should treat our minds, that is, ourselves, as innocent and
ingenuous children, whose guardians we are, and be careful what objects and
what subjects we thrust on their attention.</em> Read not the Times. Read the
Eternities. <cite>(Thoreau, 1863)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This essay proposes the <em>survivorship</em> bias as the criteria to determine which
media to ignore as mundane, cheap, and ephemeral. Survivorship sets the focus on
knowledge that has withstood the test of time; Nicholas Taleb makes the
following recommendation in <em>Antifragile</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[read] as little as feasible from the last twenty years, except history books
that are not about the last fifty years. [...what most people do] is read
timely material that becomes instantly obsolete. (Taleb, 2012)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aaron Swartz had similar sentiments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its obsession with the criminal and the deviant makes us less trusting people.
Its obsession with the hurry of the day-to-day makes us less reflective
thinkers. Its obsession with surfaces makes us shallow.
<cite>(Swartz, 2006)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Survivorship is a simple heuristic with which to judge media, be it books, news,
social media, television, academic journal articles or even video games. A
clickbait article can go viral and get millions of views the first day it's
published, but according to the survivorship bias, its newness means that it’s
likely to be obsolete the next day. Rather than trying to judge for yourself if
media is worth your attention, try letting the survivorship bias do the work for
you.</p>
<p>The survivorship bias has a few knock-on effects that are worth mentioning.
Media tends to be discounted as it ages. Video games are always on sale a few
months and especially years after they’ve been released; Books and movies are
always cheaper well after their release as well; Newspapers are free the day
after they were published; and so on. Beyond saving our attention from instantly
obsolete media, we will also be saving money simply by waiting long enough. With
time also comes more in-depth analysis from the surrounding community; reviews
and deep interpretations of the rich meaning behind film and video games benefit
from the additional time it takes for this analysis to blossom. This cultural
analysis isn’t available to those following the cult-of-the-new.</p>
<h2>Media Consumption Strike</h2>
<p>Now that we understand how the territory of our attention has been colonized, we
can begin to resist. Our challenge is to put the following strategies in
practice until they form new habits that encourage idleness and mental
spaciousness. We have the tools to reclaim our time and imaginations, we must
take action!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The inadvertent laboring towards the propagation of the spectacle is another
example of the ways that the spectacle takes advantage of its subordination of
the masses. It is a process to which they have no control other than to
renounce image culture completely which in a hyperreal world is almost
inconceivable. <cite>(Berthelot, 2013)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any efforts to reform the practices that produce the addictive symptoms of the
attention economy will fail to address the underlying structures of late
capitalism that created these markets—namely, market fundamentalism, technologic
determinism, deregulation, and privatization (Tanner, 2018).</p>
<p>Given that; we propose a collective media consumption strike, and rather than
allowing our attention to be driven by these platforms, we must direct our
attention to the things that matter to us.</p>
<p>The rules can be simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>No advertising-sponsored TV or Youtube</li>
<li>No commercial radio, news, or news aggregation</li>
<li>No commercial social media, delete your Facebook account</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a holier-than-thou asceticism, but a refusal to have our attention
destroyed and exploited. Don’t be a fundamentalist about the rules. Rules are
meant to be broken. If it’s art, the rules are more loose; if it’s corporate
media, more strict. Cinema, literature, sci-fi, comic books, indie games (or
board games): as long as these types of works are not connected with our
professional, interpersonal, or political responsibilities, use them in
moderation. In general, make sure media consumption is done with more moderation
than usual. The goal is to break your habits.</p>
<p>Many people work with computers for their job. Most aren’t privileged enough to
be able to completely disconnect from work. Work-related email, messaging, and
work-related browsing are out of scope for the strike by necessity—but do please
try to prevent any non-work related web browsing or media consumption. Don’t use
work as an excuse to view social media or browse the web. Academic journal
articles and the like will be hard to avoid, but ask yourself if they would pass
the survivorship bias after a few years.</p>
<p>Enable Do Not Disturb on your phone. This will establish designated mental space
for ourselves, friends, and family. Most smartphones have rules that can
automatically put the device into Do Not Disturb mode at set times. In Android
and iOS, this is available by going to Settings and searching for Do Not Disturb
preferences. Do Not Disturb is also available in macOS as well.</p>
<p>Remove anything that provides <em>variable information rewards</em>. These are features
in apps and games designed to give a random, pleasant surprise—to create
addiction. Slot machines are designed to do this; social media platforms like
Facebook, Twitter, and video games like Candy Crush use “loot crates” to achieve
the same result. Email can operate similarly. Turn off the red Notification dot
on all your apps.</p>
<p>Remove Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Slack, Instagram, Youtube and any other
commercial social media apps from your devices. This makes it tougher to have
instant access to these forms of media since it's not immediately at your
fingertips. Don’t cheat and use the web interface. Disable notifications for any
apps that you keep. Turn off all lock screen notifications, this also improves
privacy. Remove any of the other chat apps from your smartphone: Snapchat,
Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Mastodon, Viber. If our friends need to reach us,
they can text or call. We should be the masters of our own time, and our network
of friends isn’t in control of our time. Our inbox isn’t the world’s way to add
items to our TODO list.</p>
<p>Remove any Bookmarks or Recently Viewed sites from your browser to prevent
1-click-away sites from distracting us. Some software like SelfControl will
block habitual sites for you. Reddit, BuzzFeed, Upworthy, Medium are great sites
to block.</p>
<p>Try to limit checking email to once a day. Set a schedule at a set time, and
stick to it. Do the same for messaging. Set an auto-responder if that helps
reduce anxiety.</p>
<p>Tell your friends why you are leaving commercial social media, make it clear
that your reason to leave is political, and not because you're ignoring them.
Give your friends a direct way of reaching you.</p>
<p>The idea behind this practice is to stop the urge to immediately unlock our
phone whenever we have idle time. Our idle time should be owned by us.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The net effect these platforms have on us is to alienate us from our very lives.
Instead of focusing on what is valuable and good, we tend to focus on what we
lack, or what we’re missing out on. If we divest ourselves from this tendency,
ignore the rare incidents and ephemeral content that has no actual relevance to
our daily lives, the net effect is beneficial to our mind and spirit. The
resulting autonomy of attention can allow us to connect to the people and
environments around us, and reclaim our very imaginations.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Reasons to Quit Facebook</h2>
<p>The ideological rationale that keeps platforms like Facebook profiting from the
commodification of our attention and the collection of our private data lacks
common courtesy at best, and is psychopathic at worst. Here we present our
Airing of Grievances, a listicle of the top reasons to quit Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook outsources data exploitation for political manipulation to companies
like Cambridge Analytica. (Cadwalladr, Graham-Harrison, 2018).</p>
<p>Facebook has democratized surveillance, where we have normalized reporting upon
the intimate details of the status of our friends and family. (e.g. "X got
engaged to Y", "Tagged my friend A in this photo, at location X", "B works at
company C.").</p>
<p>Without privacy, people resort to self-censorship, and therefore remove any
aspect of political action or critique from themselves, thus becoming normalized
to political impotence. (Assange, Appelbaum, Müller-Maguhn, Zimmermann, 2012).</p>
<p>Former founding President Sean Parker, along with former vice-president of user
growth Chamath Palihapitiya have both objected to Facebook’s use of
dopamine-driven feedback loops to increase addictive behavior. (Hern, 2018).</p>
<p>Former Chief Information Security Officer Alex Stamos resigned from Facebook
over an internal disagreement in how much Facebook should publicly share about
how nation-states used the platform in the run-up to the 2016 elections.
(Perlroth, Frenkel, Shane, 2018).</p>
<p>Co-founder of WhatsApp (acquired by Facebook) Brian Acton has said people should
#DeleteFacebook. (Newton, 2018).</p>
<p>Co-founder of WhatsApp Jan Koum, is planning to leave the company after clashing
with its parent, Facebook, over the popular messaging service’s strategy and
Facebook’s attempts to use its personal data and weaken its encryption.
(Dwoskin, 2018).</p>
<p>Facebook correlates data from loyalty program providers (e.g. Walgreens cards
from Nielsen-Catalina Solutions) who have access to brick-and-mortar purchase
history with individual Facebook accounts. Companies like Johnson &#x26; Johnson can
buy this data from the broker and use Facebook tools to target individual users
for ads promoting products they've previously purchased. (Stern, 2018).</p>
<p>Facebook has been fined for breaking privacy laws in the EU for using cookies,
and social plugins. (Lomas, 2018).</p>
<p>Facebook’s corporate policy is based on growth and engagement at any cost.
(Malik, 2018).</p>
<p>Facebook’s Protect VPN product is collecting users’ mobile data traffic and
sending it back to Facebook. (Perez, 2018).</p>
<p>Facebook hired a full time pollster to monitor Mark Zuckerberg’s approval
ratings and develop strategies to change public perceptions. (Newton, 2018).</p>
<p>Facebook’s network <em>"is large enough and deep enough to create a global census
that can ‘see’ nearly everyone on the planet, even if they don’t have a Facebook
account.”</em> says John Robb, a former counter-terrorism operative in US Special
Operations Command. He goes on to say, this will <em>“enable real-time tracking on
nearly everyone on the planet using smartphone GPS data and ancillary
information”.</em> (Ahmed, 2017).</p>
<p>“Facebook’s business is to simulate you and to own and control your simulation,
thereby owning and controlling you.” (Balkan, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook has experimented with removing popular news outlets from the Feed in
poor countries including Sri Lanka, Guatemala, Bolivia, Cambodia, Serbia and
Slovakia. (Hern, 2017).</p>
<p>Former Facebook platform team Operations Manager Sandy Parakilas claims the
company prioritized data collection of its users over protecting them from
abuse. (Parakilas, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook Likes can be leveraged to reliably predict intelligence, personality
traits and politics. (Hess, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook uses messages and contact details of our friends and other Facebook
users to build a shadow profile of us that makes it easier for Facebook to more
completely map all our social connections. (Hill, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook still knows what you typed before [and after] you hit delete. (Boykis,
2017).</p>
<p>Facebook will tag your face in any photos uploaded from any users. (Boykis,
2017).</p>
<p>Facebook became 45% of all referral sources of traffic between 2014 and 2017.
This has an enormous influence on what people see on the web, making the web
more centralized upon Facebook. (Staltz, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook is filing patents to detect and use emotion to influence users’
behaviors. (CB Insights, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook uses gamification to incentivize us to keep checking how many Likes our
posts have gotten. A narcissism reinforcement machine. (Dillet, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook uses nostalgia, birthdays, and sentimentality to manipulate us to
increase engagement. (Frost, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook’s Like button (seen on almost every site on the web) isn't just there
to make it easy to post that page on Facebook, but it also provides a hook for
Facebook to track your visit to that site, and thus collect your entire web
browsing history. (Satyal, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook revealed the identities of its own content censors to suspected
terrorists. (Solon, 2017).</p>
<p>When Facebook has trouble acquiring users in specific markets, it simply buys
the companies that dominate those markets (e.g. Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus).
(Srnicek, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook owns a patent to use our devices’ camera to gauge our emotional state
from our facial expression, to better to target us with content and advertising.
(Dowling, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook prevents search indexing, so content posted on Facebook is only
discoverable within Facebook. (Gruber, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook fragments the public debate into filter-bubbles, and users segmented
into one bubble will never see the news and information in another bubble,
separating society along ideological lines. (Lanchester, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook can identify when teens feel "insecure", "worthless" and "need a
confidence boost" in order to keep them hooked. (Lewis,. Machkovech, 2017).</p>
<p>The data we give Facebook is used to calculate our ethnic affinity, sexual
orientation, political affiliation, social class, travel schedule and much more.
(Miller, 2017).</p>
<p>Facebook buys personal data from various data brokers, and correlates it to
Facebook profile data to build aggregated profiles that span multiple sources.
(Angwin, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook News team suppressed conservative news items. (Nunez, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook prevented News Team curators from listing Facebook on their resume in
order to make the organization seem like it was unbiased and AI-driven. (Nunez,
2016).</p>
<p>Facebook can use your name and photo to endorse products and services to your
social network without your knowledge. (Tucker, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook is the television of the web, letting us passively scroll through
content that we'd probably like, based on our habits and things we've already
Liked, putting us in comfort bubbles that are more isolating than physical
walls. (Derakhshan, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook creates an illusion of choice, but by shaping the menus we pick from,
it hijacks the way we perceive our choices and replaces them with new ones that
aren’t in our best interests but serve the interests of Facebook. (Harris,
2016).</p>
<p>Facebook Likes, status updates, and pages we visit are "more reliable" in
predicting mental illness. (Reynolds, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook uses intermittent variable rewards, used in slot machines to maximize
addictiveness, by linking an action we take (pull-to-refresh) and a random
reward (e.g. new posts!). (Harris, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook convinces us that we're missing out on something important, when in
reality we’re not. (Harris, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook abuses our need for social approval, validation, and the need to belong
in order to increase engagement. (Harris, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook abuses our need to reciprocate the social gestures of others. (E.g. the
need to Friend someone back who has Friended you). (Harris, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook abuses our attention with immediate interruptions because studies have
shown it increases engagement. (Harris, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook abuses our intentions by hijacking our tasks with the needs of the
platform. For example, when you want to look up a Facebook event happening
tonight, the app doesn't allow us to access the event without first redirecting
us to the News feed. (Harris, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook makes it easy for us to handover self-incriminating data that can be
used against us by law-enforcement. (Clark, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook blocked the account of activist Shaun King after he posted a racist
email that was sent to him. (Stallman, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook enforces a real name policy, allowing corporations and nation-states to
be able to connect users’ accounts with their real identity. This is dangerous
for marginalized people, and makes them vulnerable to blackmail lest their real
identities be exposed. The real name policy forces people to have a single
identity when in reality people have flexible identities that change depending
on social context. Using one’s real name inhibits one from experimenting with
alternative identities, limiting personal growth to normative concepts of
identity. (Stallman, 2016).</p>
<p>Facebook has censored posts for Israel, Russia, China, Turkey, the UK, and
routinely suppresses content for political reasons using algorithmic promotion
and depromotion. (Stallman, 2016).</p>
<p>On the web, hyperlinks are freely swapped to enable the cross-pollination of
information and a diversity of decentralized ideas. On Facebook, each post
exists unto itself, often accessible only within Facebook amongst ones “Friends
of Friends”. “instead of seeing [hyperlinks] as a way to make that text richer.
You’re encouraged to post one single hyperlink and expose it to a
quasi-democratic process of liking and plussing and hearting: Adding several
links to a piece of text is not allowed. Hyperlinks are objectivized, isolated,
stripped of their powers”. (Derakhshan, 2015).</p>
<p>Facebook hurts the power of the website: “the Stream means you don’t need to
open so many websites any more. You don’t need numerous tabs. You don’t even
need a web browser. You open Twitter or Facebook on your smartphone and dive
deep in. The mountain has come to you. Algorithms have picked everything for
you. According to what you or your friends have read or seen before, they
predict what you might like to see.” (Derakhshan, 2015).</p>
<p>Facebook (even more so, Instagram) is the cul de sac of the internet. It’s where
content can no longer be enriched with annotations external to itself. It’s
where conversations wither and content goes to stare inwards at itself.</p>
<p>Facebook analyzes the contents of messages sent between users on the platform to
better target advertisements. (Virani, 2015).</p>
<p>Facebook uses friends to gather additional information about us. Tagging friends
in photos, answering questions about a friend’s marital status are ways we're
tricked into snitching on our friends. (Virani, 2015).</p>
<p>Facebook encourages us to present normative images of our lives, which results
in alienation from the actual way we feel. (Krause, 2015).</p>
<p>Increased use of Facebook is linked to depression. (Wald, 2015).</p>
<p>Facebook’s internet.org project was touted to provide internet connected devices
and networks in India, but created a Facebook-only view of the internet.
(Burrington, 2015).</p>
<p>Facebook abuses our innate tendencies to track our progress and assess our
self-worth by comparing ourselves to other people. (Musser, 2015).</p>
<p>Facebook photo data is used by Nashville company Facedeals to identify shoppers
in stores with the stores’ own security cameras and facial recognition software.
These profiles are then used to increase purchase behavior using personalized
promotions and deals. (Dormehl, 2014).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The problem with the web and its associated technologies is that it has made
it so easy to share information about ourselves that doing so begins to feel
like an obligation, a sentence, a sisyphean curse; another day, another photo
of lunch to post." <cite>(Beato, G.)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facebook manipulates our emotions with experiments on the News Feed. (Booth,
2014).</p>
<p>Facebook owns a patent for determining our location by identifying objects in
our photos and videos based on neural networks of nearby images. (Facebook,
2014).</p>
<p>Facebook payments is tracking what you buy, and your financial information like
bank account and credit card numbers. Facebook has already started sharing data
with Mastercard so they can drive online ad sales and determine credit
worthiness from platform data. (Head, 2014).</p>
<p>Facebook provided data to NSA as part of the PRISM program. (Greenwald, 2013).</p>
<p>Facebook enables a surveillance apparatus where our every action could be
monitored, and since everyone technically violates some obscure law some of the
time, then punishment becomes selective and political. (Marlinspike, 2013).</p>
<p>Facebook owns a patent that tracks and determines the types of physical
activities of a user based on movement of their device, including walking,
running, cycling, driving, skiing, etc. (Facebook, 2013).</p>
<p>Facebook owns a patent for determining our location using non-GPS data including
nearby NFC, RFID, wifi, bluetooth signal, events in your calendar like
restaurant reservations or concerts. (Facebook, March 2013)</p>
<p>Facebook sells profile data to credit card companies and insurance providers so
they can use platform data as indicators for credit and insurance risk. (Hawley,
2012).</p>
<p>Facebook makes it very difficult to quit, using social reciprocity and UX design
dark patterns. (Brown, 2010).</p>
<p>Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg hacked into Harvard Crimson editors’ private
email accounts. (Carlson, 2010).</p>

Snooze alarm, and then repeat: check email,\ncheck Facebook, check Twitter, check Snapchat, rinse; repeat again; no new\nposts? Check again. No second spared to compose a thought; dreams fade away. Day\ncontinues just the same way — rise, rinse, repeat, repeat. Can't spare time to\nsit and relax, can't let your mind wander not five minutes, no unstructured\nthought or daydream; just repeat. Every moment captures value — must increase\nengagement! must repeat! —no time for grander narratives, to solve for bigger\nproblems. Atomize attention into smaller slice of microwork, then catch up,\nread, listen, swipe right, repeat, like, pull-to-refresh, to scroll to infinity,\nand then again. No matter if you’re pulling espresso shots, serving tables, or\nplaying with computers all day: they all end the same: Netflix \u0026#x26; chill, the\nguardian of sleep, TV, our collective lullaby. Wake up with screens, go to bed\nwith screens. We no longer shit alone. The death of idleness.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis essay explores the ways Facebook transforms our attention into a product,\nand how that transformation changes us. It then proposes a social media strike\nas a concrete strategy to reclaim our attention, and finally lists many reasons\nwhy we should all quit Facebook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Commodification of Microwork\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocial media companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Snapchat have created\na marketplace for our attention, where we become the product sold to advertisers\nwho subtly change our behavior to buy products and services for their own\nbenefit. This type of persuasion is most effective when these platforms command\nour attention with a heightened level of distraction. We create the content that\nis then used to command the attention of our peers, which is then used to sell\nadvertising space while the surrounding content is measured for engagement, and\nthe results are analyzed to optimize the next round of ad placement. This\nprocess is the commodification of microwork— the seemingly small tasks that we\nare compelled to do by force of habit, tasks that aren't in our own interests\nbut in the interests of the platforms and advertisers using our attention and\ntime to pad their bottom lines. Also known as “heteromation” (Ekbia, Nardi,\n2014), microwork includes reading timelines, posting photos \u0026#x26; updates, liking,\nretweeting, and generally dedicating our time, attention, and emotions to these\nplatforms—each tiny action its own form of labor, given over freely to the\nadvertisers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The new media of surveillance capitalism solicit social behaviors, monitor\nthose behaviors, map social interactions, and resell what they learn to\nadvertisers and others.” \u003ccite\u003e(Turner, 2017)\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlatforms like Facebook are attempting to create systems for the generation of\ndistraction, Crary describes it as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“conditions that individuate, immobilize, and separate subjects, even within a\nworld in which mobility and circulation are ubiquitous. In this way attention\nbecomes key to the operation of noncoercive forms of power” \u003ccite\u003e(Crary,\n2001, pg. 74)\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, these systems continually push our attention and distraction to new\nlimits and thresholds. Youtube \u0026#x26; Netflix discovers that auto-playing the next\nrelated video dramatically increases views (Bridle, 2017); Twitter uses the\n\"pull-to-refresh\" UI gesture that leverages variable rewards to trigger\naddictive behavior as a way to increase user engagement with the timeline;\nFacebook uses the “red dot” notifications that keep people checking their phone\nfor the next new thing. These gadgets are designed to create a “supernormal\nstimulus,” that is, a stimulus that produces a stronger than natural response.\nWe can even internalize the supernormal stimulus—an example is the \"phantom\nvibrate\" we sometimes feel in our pocket when no vibration occurs. In the case\nof social media, the supernormal stimulus is used to exploit our response to\nnovelty in order to elicit a behavior that works in the interests of the social\nmedia provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis eventually leads to a crisis of attentiveness, where the system must\nmaintain an increased level of distraction. In order to continually distract us,\nthe visual landscape must constantly change, requiring us to reorient our\nattention until the shift from one thing to another becomes the natural state\n(e.g. the Instagram “Explore” tab). Over time, we begin to value our attention\nwhile the platforms struggle to get more and more of what they previously got\nfor free. This is not sustainable, as newer products need to continually\nrevolutionize the means of distraction or else we will realize how distracted we\nreally are. With a loss of distraction, we can more easily achieve self\nactualization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis process of commodification has turned us all into tastemakers, reviewers,\nlikers, retweeters and brand ambassadors. The platform takes our real authentic\nfriendships and first commodifies them,\n\u003ca class=\"Annotation-ref\" href=\"#anno:1\"\u003ereifies them\u003c/a\u003e,\n\u003cspan class=\"Annotation\" id=\"anno:1\"\u003eReification happens when something is taken\naway from a thinking subject, displaced into an object, and turned against the\nsubject.\u003c/span\u003e and then sells them back to us as an “image of friendship”, but\none that is bankrupt of any genuine social value. Over time, these platforms\ntransform us all into unpaid advertising agencies. We promote goods, services,\nlifestyles and desires to our friends, weaponizing images to generate feelings\nof jealousy and FOMO amongst our peers during those idle moments when they feel\nmost bored. These idle moments are when we are most vulnerable, and thus we’re\npsychologically primed to accept the supernormal stimulus. The platform\ncapitalizes on this vulnerability, and over time begins to redefine what we once\nconsidered “real” friendship into a relationship with the platform itself,\nmediated by the features and “images of friendship” within it through Liked and\nRetweeted posts, Snapchat streaks, Follow requests, posted text, images or even\nhow we reduce our emotions into a series of emoji (Smith, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/static/images/2018-05-01-facebook-spectacle-graph.svg\"\n    alt=\"The process of commodification\" title=\"The process of commodification\"\u003e\n  \u003cfigcaption\u003eThe process of commodification\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this way, the platform is able to monetize our friendships, tastes, opinions,\nand even our emotions. Our internal thoughts and experiences become\ncommodifiable assets, measured as engagements to be analyzed, A-B tested,\noptimized and charted, then touted by executives in PowerPoint presentations at\nboard meetings. Our experiences are mined, packaged, and sold, and we are not\npaid a dime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of blindly activating our social media habit for that quick dopamine\nfix, consider who actually benefits. Are you performing a microwork task for\nFacebook or Snapchat? If so, then why aren't you being paid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat They Say vs What They Do\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/static/images/2018-05-01-facebook-spectacle.jpg\"\n    alt=\"The Society of the Facebook\" title=\"The Society of the Facebook\"\u003e\n  \u003cfigcaption\u003eThe Society of the Facebook\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNewspapers, cable news, and social media platforms are trying to turn us all\ninto media addicts. These businesses rely on persuading us to consume more and\nmore (keyword: “increase engagement”) in order to curate an “interest in current\naffairs” (e.g. New York Times) or to “build meaningful and connected\nrelationships with our community” (e.g. Facebook.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reality of the media, however, is driven by a simple business rule: Sell\nwhat sells best, the supernormal stimuli: whether it’s clickbait, memes, curated\nlifestyles, celebrity gossip, salacious headlines, and freak events. The media\ntends to focus on the rare incidents that have no actual influence on our daily\nlives, and the goal of these platforms is to keep us addicted. Facebook’s 2017\nAnnual Report makes it clear:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their\nengagement and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on\nNews Feed, partially offset by increasing user engagement with video content\nand other product changes. \u003ccite\u003e(Facebook, 2017)\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe think we’re immune to the persuasiveness of advertising, but remember,\nadvertising is a $600 billion dollar industry that is the financial basis of\nthe tech sector. The massive profits these companies have built have been done\nso on the backs of advertising campaigns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacebook’s (and Google’s, etc.) real agenda is to display and sell ads—not to\nhelp people “build meaningful and connected relationships.” At no point was this\nmore clear than during Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony before Congress. When Senator\nHatch asked him, “How do you sustain a business model in which people don’t pay\nfor your service?” his response was as straightforward as it could’ve been:\n“Senator, we run ads.” (NBC News, 2018).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n2H8wx1aBiQ?rel=0\u0026amp;controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen style=\"max-width: 100%;\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n \u003cfigcaption\u003eSenator, we run ads.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Building Relationships” is the rationale used in order to serve the\nadvertisements, but the advertisements themselves are the real content of these\nplatforms. The business arrangement of the platform is a simple one: ads are the\ncontent, the advertisers are the clients, the user doing microwork tasks are the\nworkers, and \u003cem\u003eour future behaviors are the product\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result, we end up building relationships to the platform—not to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the investment of our attention, we allow the commodities and ideologies\nof the platform to bombard our unconscious and subtly shape our behavior. The\nprocess of \"exchanging time for image, provides the counterflow to the moving\nimage and as advertising revenues would indicate, is itself productive of\nvalue.\" (Beller 2006, p.79)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Facebook’s nearly one billion users have become the largest unpaid workforce\nin history\" \u003ccite\u003e(Laney, 2012)\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intended effect the media wishes to create is media-driven neuroticism—a\nlove of change for its own sake, or neomania, a love of new things. Ultimately,\nneomania together with the media has a negative effect on our moods, which isn’t\nsurprising considering most of what makes the daily news is negative. This\nleaves us feeling powerless, like the world is falling apart. So we turn to\nsocial media to witness the (seemingly) beautiful lives of celebrities, and the\nromantic and exciting lives of our friends and family. But this ends up driving\nthe compulsion to compare our own lives with those of the people we see on\nsocial media, creating feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, and jealousy. These\nfeelings are misguided however, since the lives we see in the media and social\nplatforms are a tightly edited and curated spectacle of people presenting an\n\u003cem\u003eimage of how they want to appear, not of how they actually are.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePractical Defense Against Unpaid Microwork\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"/static/images/2018-04-24-against-facebook.jpg\"\n    alt=\"News Feed, by Beeple\" title=\"News Feed, by Beeple\"\u003e\n  \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n    \u003ca href=\"https://www.artstation.com/artwork/6VW95\" title=\"News Feed\"\u003e\"News\n      Feed\"\u003c/a\u003e,\n    by Beeple.\n  \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday it's popular to hear about the media detox or a social media diet. The\nconcept is often framed as a metaphor for eating and weight loss. We can extend\nthis metaphor to consider the microwork tasks we find ourselves doing on a daily\nbasis. Are the habits and media and we consume daily like the healthy foods that\nwe can use to build a healthy mind and body? Or will they ultimately poison us?\nTo live a healthy life we should moderate our media consumption the same way we\ndo with the things we eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe toxicity of the media can be understood as a signal-to-noise problem. The\nmore media we consume, the more noise we get (rather than the valuable part,\ncalled the signal.) If we consume the news on a yearly basis (in the form of\nbooks), we can assume about half of what we consume is signal, and the rest\nnoise (randomness). If we increase our frequency to a daily intake, the\ncomposition would increase to about 95% noise, and only 5% signal. If we\nincrease our intake to an hourly frequency (as those who follow the stock market\nor heavy social media users do) the composition increases to 99.5% noise and\n0.5% signal. This is roughly 200% more noise than signal, more toxic noise to\nboth misdirect and distract, and has negative effects on our mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistraction could be described as a phenomenon in which you connect,\ninadvertently or absentmindedly, to more things than you intended.

Distance creates an opportunity to gain new perspectives on the media\n(and life in general). This distance reduces the influence of these platforms,\nand creates a space for our ideas and imagination to flourish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdleness and imagination are essential to our wellbeing, they’re the wellspring\nof mental clarity, and the backstop for memory. Take a few minutes each day to\ncultivate idleness and some mental space. Step away from the hourly, daily,\nweekly media cycle, and read books instead. Books benefit from the perspective\nof time, which results in more settled and established facts with increased\ndepth of analysis.

We should ignore those things that bring no happiness or value to our\nlives. Instead, we should focus our attention on our imagination, quality\nthought, friends and family, idleness; on things that matter. We should explore\neffective ways to reclaim clarity of thought, and autonomy of attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe task is to change the very way we attend the world around us.

(Stallman, 2016).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacebook has censored posts for Israel, Russia, China, Turkey, the UK, and\nroutinely suppresses content for political reasons using algorithmic promotion\nand depromotion.

Hyperlinks are objectivized, isolated,\nstripped of their powers”. (Derakhshan, 2015).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacebook hurts the power of the website: “the Stream means you don’t need to\nopen so many websites any more. You don’t need numerous tabs.
