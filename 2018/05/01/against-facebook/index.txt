9:T4ac,Social media companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Snapchat have created
a marketplace for our attention, where we become the product sold to advertisers
who subtly change our behavior to buy products and services for their own
benefit. This type of persuasion is most effective when these platforms command
our attention with a heightened level of distraction. We create the content that
is then used to command the attention of our peers, which is then used to sell
advertising space while the surrounding content is measured for engagement, and
the results are analyzed to optimize the next round of ad placement. This
process is the commodification of microwork‚Äî the seemingly small tasks that we
are compelled to do by force of habit, tasks that aren‚Äôt in our own interests
but in the interests of the platforms and advertisers using our attention and
time to pad their bottom lines. Also known as ‚Äúheteromation‚Äù (Ekbia, Nardi,
2014), microwork includes reading timelines, posting photos & updates, liking,
retweeting, and generally dedicating our time, attention, and emotions to these
platforms‚Äîeach tiny action its own form of labor, given over freely to the
advertisers.a:T471,This process of commodification has turned us all into tastemakers, reviewers,
likers, retweeters and brand ambassadors. The platform takes our real authentic
friendships and first commodifies them,
reifies them, and then sells them back to us as an ‚Äúimage of friendship‚Äù, but
one that is bankrupt of any genuine social value. Over time, these platforms
transform us all into unpaid advertising agencies. We promote goods, services,
lifestyles and desires to our friends, weaponizing images to generate feelings
of jealousy and FOMO amongst our peers during those idle moments when they feel
most bored. These idle moments are when we are most vulnerable, and thus we‚Äôre
psychologically primed to accept the supernormal stimulus. The platform
capitalizes on this vulnerability, and over time begins to redefine what we once
considered ‚Äúreal‚Äù friendship into a relationship with the platform itself,
mediated by the features and ‚Äúimages of friendship‚Äù within it through Liked and
Retweeted posts, Snapchat streaks, Follow requests, posted text, images or even
how we reduce our emotions into a series of emoji (Smith, 2016).b:T417,The reality of the media, however, is driven by a simple business rule: Sell
what sells best, the supernormal stimuli: whether it‚Äôs clickbait, memes, curated
lifestyles, celebrity gossip, salacious headlines, and freak events. In the drive
to maximize profit, these organizations are required to maximize content engagement,
and the kind of content engages users the most is content that enrages, shocks, content
that‚Äôs absurd, grotesque, weird, or funny, content that exposes the horrible, or content
with threatening policies. The media tends to focus on the rare incidents
that have no actual influence on our daily lives, and the goal of these platforms
is to keep us addicted. This attentiveness to negativity is then reinforced to the
point of addiction, and addiction to negativity turns to depression and teaches us
learned helplessness. Quoting media researcher Dobelli ‚ÄúWhen we tune into the news,
we are constantly confronted with unresolved problems and the narrative does not
inspire much hope that they will ever be solved.‚Äù 2:["$","article",null,{"className":"hentry h-entry","children":[["$","header",null,{"children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"entry-title p-name","children":"Against Facebook"}],"$undefined",["$","time",null,{"className":"display-date_published__A_L_d dt-published","dateTime":"2018-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","children":"Tuesday May 1, 2018"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"h-card page_byline__wbXsN","children":[" by ",["$","span",null,{"className":"fn p-author p-name","children":"0xADADA"}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"entry-content e-content","children":[["$","aside",null,{"children":["$","p",null,{"children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"https://nadarespetable.com/2020/03/25/contra-facebook-parte-1/","children":"Contra Facebook, Parte 1"}],",\n",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://nadarespetable.com/2020/03/26/contra-facebook-parte-2/","children":"Contra Facebook, Parte 2"}]]}]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"On the commodification of attention, the abuses of unpaid microwork and\nstrategies of resistance."}],"\n",["$","figure",null,{"className":"rehype-figure","children":[["$","img",null,{"src":"/static/images/2018-05-01-against-facebook-title.jpg","alt":"Against Facebook"}],["$","figcaption",null,{"children":"Against Facebook"}]]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["$","em",null,{"children":"Alarm goes off, time to wake up.
